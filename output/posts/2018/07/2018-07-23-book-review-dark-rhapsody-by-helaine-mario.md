I wanted to like Dark Rhapsody – and I did… at first. But then, I just lost interest. It wasn’t that it switched between character points of view because that’s normal and I don’t have a problem with it. It also wasn’t that the book was lacking in action, because the book isn’t. It’s got plenty of intrigue, plenty of action, and plenty that _should_ have kept me interested. But… I just wasn’t.

The book itself is great. I cannot deny that the book, up to where I left off, was great. It was just that for some reason, I lost interest in the book. Perhaps it is my overwhelming NetGalley TBR pile that I keep adding books to because I’m being requested to. Perhaps it is because I have a TBR pile a mile high of eBooks that I own. Or perhaps right now just isn’t the time for me to finish this book.

I’ll definitely be getting my own copy of this book – and looking to see if there is a book that goes before it, as it seems as though this is a sequel to some other book. Perhaps that is part of my problem as well. I don’t care to read books out of series, so perhaps I just need to get the previous book(s). I **do** recommend this book, I just couldn’t seem to finish it at the moment.
