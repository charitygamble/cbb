I’m not one much for the romance genre, even though it seems like I have quite a few in my NetGalley queue. But Bad Night Stand called to me because it seemed like it would be right up my alley.

I wasn’t wrong. I loved it. And in all honesty, I’m sincerely hoping that the author puts more of her books on NetGalley because I’m dying to read them all!

Abby and Jordan are great main characters. The development is great, even if you have to wait a bit to find out what makes them tick. You’ll probably hate Abby’s dad, which isn’t a surprise, but you’ll love Abby and Jordan. You’ll also come to love Seraphina, Bec, and Heather. And we can’t forget Hunter – he’s an absolute doll and you’ll love him as soon as he pops up in the book.

This story will tug your heart strings, make you laugh, and tick you off. There is some strong language in the book, which doesn’t bother me, but I thought I would mention it for those who might be bothered by strong language. There are also a few sex scenes for those who aren’t into that type of thing either.

This well written story is the first in a series and I am seriously chomping at the bit for the second book in the series after reading the epilogue. Trust me on this, you will be too!
