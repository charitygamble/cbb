The sequel to _City of Bones_, _City of Ashes_ is no less addicting and action packed than it’s predecessor. Just like City of Bones, I didn’t want to put the book down. Lately, that seems like a near impossibility for me.

I realized after perusing the library’s website that there are actually six books in The Mortal Instruments series as opposed to five. For some reason I managed to miss the fact that a sixth book came out entirely. That just makes me even happier because I don’t want this story to end!

I’ve come to absolutely adore Jace and Clary but I’m still not sure if I really like Isabelle all that much. Alec is growing on me and while I know part of his story because of all the Tumblr posts about the Shadowhunters TV series, I can’t wait to see how it plays out in the books. Luke is another favorite character. And while I hated The Inquisitor, I was sad to see how her portion of the story ended.

I can’t wait for the third book to become available again – I had to turn in books 3-5 because they were due and had holds on them. I’ve got holds on all four of the remaining books and I can’t wait to get my hands on them!
