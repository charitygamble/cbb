I’ve been dying to get my hands on this series for a LONG time, so when I saw all five were available at my local library, I pounced. I read _City of Bones_ in 2 days, which is pretty fast for me with a book that is 485 pages.

This book was definitely worth the hype I’d seen for it. It’s amazing! And the Shadowhunters TV series? Doesn’t do the book justice. In fact, I didn’t like the TV series (I know, blasphemy) so I was sincerely hoping the books would be far better. I wasn’t disappointed.

I love Clary & Jace… not fond of Isabelle or Alec. I’d like to take Valentine out and just… well… get rid of him because he’s such a royal pain as a bad guy. But then again, if I didn’t want to get rid of him, he wouldn’t be a very good bad guy now would he? Simon’s a pretty cool character as well. I love how he feels about Clary although sometimes the way he treats her just sucks.

I can’t wait to delve into the other books – I just hope I can read them all before I have to take them back!
