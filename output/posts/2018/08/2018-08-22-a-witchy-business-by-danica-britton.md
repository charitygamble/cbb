* * *

I chose to read _A Witchy Business_ because I like books about witches and because, well, it said it was a cozy mystery and I’ve been trying to figure out exactly what a cozy mystery actually is. Well, I finally figured out that cozy mysteries are basically mysteries with a little bit of romance sprinkled in and that they’re not very detailed or bloody. They just have a murder that isn’t too gory and some amateur detective who has one reason or another to help the police along.

I was a bit startled to see that for the most part, there isn’t a whole lot of magic involved in this book. Yes, there are a couple of spells cast and a potion or two, but for the most part, the only magic you’ll really see is Harper talking to ghosts. Which is interesting and funny in its own right, but doesn’t make for a particularly magical book. Honestly, Harper could have been a medium and not connected to a long line of witches and the book would still have made sense from her perspective. Being that _A Witchy Business_ is the first in a series, I’m hoping that further books explore the magical possibilities because what fun is a series about witches that doesn’t really have magic in it?

As far as the characters are concerned, even though I know that the new deputy, Joe McGrady, is supposed to be something of a love interest for Harper, I wasn’t impressed with him. He irked me and I just can’t see those two together. Harper is sweet and lovable, talking to ghosts and only wanting to be of some help to them, even if it gets her into some sticky situations. I’m still not sure what to think of Grandma Grant or Jess.

I gave this book 4 stars because it’s a quick read, it’s funny, and it’s cute. I would suggest this one to fans of cozy mysteries as you’ll definitely enjoy it. It would also make a great introduction to the world of cozy mysteries.
