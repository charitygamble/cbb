_Destiny’s a Witch_ is a cute, cozy, kitschy mystery involving a town full of witches, warlocks, and humans. Throw in a bit of romance and you have this adorable story. This is what a cute, cozy mystery should be.

I chose to read this book based on two things – the cute cover and the title. I figured the book would be cute and I wasn’t disappointed in the least. For someone who normally reads books that are either sexually charged, horror, fantasy, or YA, this was a refreshing change from the normal. Lucy May did an excellent job of spinning a tale of murder, romance, and fun without all the cursing and dark themes that normally pervade the books I read.

Moira is a sweet, lovable woman who might have made a magical mistake in the past – one that it seems she can’t let go of as she mentions is multiple times in the book. Liam is the dashing ex-flame who might be an ex but is still a flame and frankly, I agree with the idea that they’re fated to be together, but I’m just the reader, so what do I know? You’ll get a big kick out of the antics of the twins and all the meddling and gossiping about Moira and Liam.

I loved that the background of the town itself was given as opposed to just making the town the place they live and nothing more. It gave the story, and I’ll dare say the series, more depth to have the town itself have a background besides just giving the characters a background. I love the little town and I can’t wait to read more about it.

I did find that there were a few places in this book where the spelling or grammar was off – sometimes words were misspelled, sometimes words were missing, and sometimes the wrong words were in place. If this is something that bothers you a lot, you’ll want to keep this in mind. However, as I did have an uncorrected ARC of the book, it is possible that these issues may be fixed by the time this is properly published.

I gave this book 5 stars for the absolute joy it was to read and how utterly cute this book was. I can’t wait to read the second book which is due out in October 2018.
