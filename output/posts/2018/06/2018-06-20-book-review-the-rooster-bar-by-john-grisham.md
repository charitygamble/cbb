I'll be honest, I haven't read a John Grisham novel in years. I was really into his novels when I was in high school, but to be honest, after high school I kind of lost interest. I think the last time I'd read one of his novels was back in the early 2000s when I still lived in Texas.

The book was all right, but it wasn't the type of story I'm used to from John Grisham. I'm used to his books being more like The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill. This one wasn't so much like that and I guess I was just expecting another lawyer making a name for him/herself because he/she took on a case that was making big headlines.

The book was well written, although you might have to get a notepad to keep track of changing names and what's going on with each person's family because it can get a bit on the complicated side. I don't think this book had quite as much character development as previous novels and to be honest, I think that was part of why I didn't like it. It just didn't have that John Grisham feel.

All in all, it was a good book but not one I'd really recommend to long time fans of John Grisham.
