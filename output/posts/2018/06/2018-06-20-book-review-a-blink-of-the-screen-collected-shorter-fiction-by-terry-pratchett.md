This was my first foray into reading Terry Pratchett and I have to say, although the stories were good, they weren't GREAT.

Part of this is due to some of the stories having been written a long time ago, when he'd first started writing. Part of this is also due to my not being particularly knowledgeable about Discworld, and so the Discworld stories didn't really make any sense to me.

Terry Pratchett's writing style is very good. He knows how to tell a story. I'm not denying that. He knows how to develop characters in just a few short sentences so that a short story can get on with it. But some of the earlier works - I'm just not sure why the editors and publisher were willing to have them in thereâ€¦ and Terry himself was rather embarrassed by some of the stories.

All in all, it was a good introduction to Terry Pratchett and I would recommend it to those who haven't read his works as a way to introduce themselves to his writing style. Just keep in mind that some of the stories are from way back when and could use a little work.
