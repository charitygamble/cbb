I love secret societies. Whenever I read a book set in a school, that is one of my biggest hopes - that there is some sort of secret society involved in the plot. Well, with _A Darker Mischief_, that hope is definitely fulfilled.

This book is definitely a slow-burn type of book. It will take a while to fully get into the story. It will also take a while to start understanding the characters presented _A Darker Mischief_. This is not one of those books where you get the characters' life story at the beginning. Even our main character, Cal, largely remains a mystery until later in the book. And if someone's story isn't important to the plot? Well, their story remains untold.

I have to say that I actually liked Luke more than I liked Cal. He seemed more genuine than Cal did. But Cal had his moments. Now for some reason, I'd suspected one of the secrets Cal held, but when it was revealed, I was still surprised. And no, I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to read the book to find out.

I loved the Society of Seven Eyes. For me, it is what made _A Darker Mischief_ a four-star read. I loved the parties, the mystery, and the fact that the society's main "raison d'Ãªtre" is to explore the grounds of Essex and dig up all of the history about the school. Including, perhaps, some secrets that pertain to Society.

The ending for _A Darker Mischief_ was great. It perfectly closed out the book - and even left the book open for something of a sequel if perhaps a certain character wanted revenge on those who'd "wronged" him. I mean, the book ends perfectly as is, but a sequel could be fun as well\[mfn\]Honestly, I'm always up for sequel for most books.\[/mfn\].

If you are a fan of books that contain secret societies, I guarantee you'll want to read this book. Society of Seven Eyes features prominently in this story but so do the characters, which is important. I gave this one four-stars and hope to read more books from Derek Milman in the future.
