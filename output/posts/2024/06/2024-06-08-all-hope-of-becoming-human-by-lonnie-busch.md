When I saw _All Hope of Becoming_ Human by Lonnie Busch in the Edelweiss+ "to download" category, I thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did!

One of Mr. Busch's influences is Stephen King and you can definitely see that in this novel. He expertly crafted the kind of allegory that Mr. King uses - where the people are the problem, not the fantastical monsters that plague them. Not only that, but he blended science fiction and horror in a way that made them seamless, something that I've seen many other authors try and fail to do.

Mr. Busch has created a cast of characters in _All Hope of Becoming Human_ that are not only likeable, but ones that you will genuinely care about. You'll grieve their losses, celebrate their successes, and sit in shock at what they endure.

Rebecca is an enigma for the majority of the book and it works. So many times I wondered what was going on with her - why she was acting the way she was. When it all came together toward the end of the novel, it not only made sense, but it made me glad it had happened that way.

I also enjoyed Demzey's character - he was one tough cookie who also showed emotion. That isn't something you often get from male authors - for some reason, the male characters just aren't that emotionally charged. I appreciated that with Demzey.

The plot to this one is obvious and not at the same time. You can see the tendrils of the plot but you're often left wondering where they are going, which is not a bad thing. You'll find points that you know are integral to the plot of _All Hope of Becoming Human_, but yet they seem to lead nowhere before being explained later. When they are explained, you'll see why they weren't explained to begin with - because it wouldn't have made sense then.

The ending made me a bit sad, a bit glad, and actually made me wish for a sequel - because I'd love to see what happens next after this book left off... hint, hint, Mr. Busch! All in all, this was a solid 4.5 star read and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes horror and science fiction mixed together!
