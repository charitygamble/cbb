I periodically receive emails from NetGalley telling me what books are "Read Now". In the most recent email, _What the Woods Took_ was listed among the books on offer. While I had previously seen Courtney Gould's other books on NetGalley, I had not been lucky enough to be chosen to read them. But since this one was "Read Now" I managed to snag it. I'm so glad I was able to get it.

In this book we follow five teenagers who have been sent away to "wilderness therapy" by their parents/guardians. Our illustrious group consists of:

- Devin - nearly 18 years old, has been in foster care for most of her life, resorts to violence to solve her problems.

- Sheridan - a rich girl with a tragic past, she has a tendency to be quite the bitch to others

- Hannah - a girl you'd think would be the last person on earth to be sent to "wilderness therapy"

- Aidan - a younger teen who just wanted to be liked

- Ollie - a teen relatively close in age to Devin who did something bad, but not what his dad thought

As we follow these five teens on their wilderness therapy journey, we find that things in this wilderness aren't exactly what they seem. One of the things I loved about this book is that the enemy isn't what you'd expect - and in some cases might actually be someone you know!

I found the writing style in _What the Woods Took_ to be extremely easy to follow and I was very impressed with it. Ms. Gould crafted this story with the utmost care and made it so easy to read that I finished in just a few hours. It also helped that I didn't want to put the book down!

I gave this book a four star rating - I can't wait to pick up Ms. Gould's other novels from the library. She has gained a fan for life.
