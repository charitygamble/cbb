Nicki Koziarz wrote **5 Habits of a Woman Who Doesn't Quit** for me. I have a horrible habit of quitting the things I commit to doing. I've quit going to my offline book clubs. I've quit doing things with my online book clubs. I haven't been doing things with my blogging groups. About the only thing I have not quit is going to school.

So yes, Nicki Koziarz wrote **5 Habits of a Woman Who Doesn't Quit** for me. She wrote this book for you too. After all, I'm pretty sure you quit things as well.

Nicki Koziarz writes a book about Ruth and how she doesn't quit. She details the 5 habits Ruth exhibits that means she doesn't quit when the times get tough. Using Ruth's story makes the habits Nicki is trying to tell us about easier to understand. As a result, the concepts outlined in this book are extremely easy to grasp.

When writing **5 Habits of a Woman Who Doesn't Quit**, Nicki tells us of several times in her life when she has wanted to quit. Quit working out, quit writing the book, quit trying to buy their Fixer Upper Farm (you HAVE to read that story - trust me). She lets you know that she is not perfect. She lets you know that she struggles with faith, with quitting, and with everything else. The result is a book that is funny, real, and will probably step on your toes, but in a good way.

She includes extras like sample prayers, Bible verses to help you not quit, and other things. If you are a woman who quits, **5 Habits of a Woman Who Doesn't Quit** is written for you.

I chose to give **5 Habits of a Woman Who Doesn't Quit** four stars. While this book is amazing, there is always room for improvement. I feel the book is a bit too quick of a read at only 154 pages.
