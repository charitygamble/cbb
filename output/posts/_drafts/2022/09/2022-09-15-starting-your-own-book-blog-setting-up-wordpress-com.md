So if you're not into Blogger, or for some reason it won't let you have the URL you want even though multiple searches through Google or Bing have turned up no blogs/websites with your blog name, you may want to try out WordPress.com instead.

## Getting Started

You'll need a WordPress.com account. If you've commented on WordPress.com blogs before, you may actually have one as many blogs hosted here require you to sign in with your account to leave a comment. If you do have an account, the video below will help you set your blog up.

If you need to create an account, it will take you straight into the process of creating a blog, so you may need to watch a bit further into the video to see what you'll need to do.

Again, this is a screen recording with me doing a voice over. I tried to edit out the unnecessary bits at the end, but iMovie wasn't being cooperative.

I've only covered the basics here, but will have video tutorials on how to change your theme and how to customize your theme to your liking.

Stay tuned next week for a look at how your blog would be set up if you have a friend offer you a subdomain on their paid hosting account.
