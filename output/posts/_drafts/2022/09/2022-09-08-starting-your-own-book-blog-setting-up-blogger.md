You've made a decision on how much you want to spend on your blog to begin with and you've come up with a name. Now you need to set up your blog. This week we'll go over how to start a blog on Blogger.

Blogger is owned by Google. Many people don't like Blogger because according to them "Google can delete your blog and all your hard work at any time." While this is true, it's actually true of anywhere you host your blog - Blogger, WordPress.com, even your paid web host can delete your blog if someone reports it to them and they feel the violation is severe enough to warrant doing so.

## Getting Started

The first thing you'll want to do is make sure you have a Google account. If you have a Gmail address, you have a Google account. If not, you can create one when you get started. I'm not going to go over the mechanics of creating your Google account as it's pretty self-explanatory. Just have your blog name and your Google login information ready. Remember to have variations of your blog name or backup names in case the one you want is taken.

Below I've included a video I made showing you how to start your blog on Blogger. Mine shows how to do so when there is already a blog created, but if you see an empty dashboard, there will be a little Create A Blog link in the upper left-hand corner.

The above video is a screen record from my computer with me doing a voice over\[mfn\]Sorry for my voice LOL\[/mfn\].

I only cover the basics - logging in, creating the blog, and finding a theme to use. I don't get into the layout or the customization too much, other than showing you they are options. If people would like, I can work on tutorials for that as well, but I don't use Blogger very much so it might take me awhile.

I hope this is helpful to you. If you're looking to create a blog on WordPress.com, I'm going to be posting a tutorial on that next week, complete with a video.
