I've been book blogging off and on since 2006/2007. My very first "book blog" was _Bloody Kisses_, which was shamelessly taken from the Type O Negative album of the same name. I would review music, movies, and books on that blog, telling what I liked about them and what I didn't. In 2009/2010, because I didn't have the money for paid hosting anymore, I moved over to Blogger and opened _Keep on Booking_. Later on, _Keep on Booking_ became _The Bookworm Fairy_ for a short time. Then I took a break from book blogging for a couple of years before coming back with _And She Reads..._ which didn't last very long. About a year later I came back with _The Goth Girl Reads_, which morphed into _The Spooky Bookshelf_, which morphed back into _Keep on Booking_, then morphed into _Cocoa, Books, & Code_, which finally morphed into _Charli's Book Box_.

Now, I know there are a lot of resources out there for starting your own book blog. Some are written by book bloggers like myself, some look like they might have been written by bloggers just looking to cash in on providing tips for a niche blog they don't even do themselves, although it's hard to say. But there's something I've noticed about all these start-a-book-blog resources - they all want you to spend a ton of money up front to get going! They all act like going with free resources isn't OK - and that's just not true!

I'm going to tell you a secret - some of the most successful book blogs I've read started out on free Blogger or WordPress.com blogs! In fact, some of those blogs are still on Blogger or WordPress.com! Trust me, not all of these bloggers spent a ton of money on their blogs. How much money, if any at all, you spend on your blog depends largely on what **YOU** want out of your blog. So follow along with me on this weekly series that will post every Thursday morning where I'll give you tips and tricks on getting started and what to do once you do start.

Our first "lesson" will be next Thursday, August 25, 2022.
