I have to admit, I don't like politics. I find them to be far too divisive and honestly, they get boring after a while. Which is why I have no clue why I enjoy political thrillers as much as I do. For some reason, they are one of my favorite types of book to read.

_Out of Crisis_ was no exception. An interesting mix of time periods - the days leading up to and just after a huge natural disaster and two years prior to that disaster. There is also another time period that we go through, but it is more for background information than anything else.

This book gives a fictional glimpse into what could happen should a third major political party make an attempt to rise to power - and what could happen if that party did rise to power. The part in question - Centrist - wants to make Constitutional changes that they believe will be for the better, but they need the right candidate and the right circumstances. Enter David Stakley as the right candidate. Enter a major natural disaster as the right circumstances.

The book bounces between the time periods but it is done in a clean manner - the majority of the time jumps are done at chapter changes and are clearly marked as to what time period you are currently reading about. This makes the time jumps easy to follow along with and the timelines with their accompanying story lines are easy to keep track of - you won't get lost in the mix when switching back and forth. They're very clear and distinct until they finally merge together at which point it won't matter as you won't need to keep track of them separately any longer.

_Out of Crisis_ is very well written. While it does deal with Constitutional law in some places, the basics are given in terms that the reader can understand. Of course, these laws may not be real, but even if they aren't, they're still easy to understand for the reader. The plot lines are easy to follow and they are written in a manner that is easy to read and has a medium paced flow. According to my Kindle, the book would take around 8 hours to read and I found that all told it did take about that long. Of course, as that is based on my reading speed, your mileage may vary.

Some people may be annoyed or offended by the scripture quotes - there aren't many and they're not meant to be used in a religious context so much as a wisdom context. Still, if you aren't a fan of Christian faiths, you may find this to be irritating or offensive. If you are a Christian, be aware there is cursing in the book, so if you find that offensive, you may want to skip this book.

I'd recommend this book to people who like political thrillers. If you aren't into political books you probably won't like this one. However, if you're looking to try out the political thriller sub-genre, I'd recommend this one as a good starting place.
