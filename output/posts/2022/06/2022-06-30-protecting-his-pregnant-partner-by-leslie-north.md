It's been a minute since I've reviewed a Leslie North book and I'm not sure why because when it comes to romance books, I absolutely love hers. Like I've said before - not big on romance, but certain authors are must-reads for me and Leslie North is one of them.

_Protecting His Pregnant Partner_ is the third book in the Aegis Security trilogy. Unfortunately, I somehow missed reading the second book, _Protecting His Fake Wife_, but fortunately, you get enough details to help you get through the books even if you don't read them in order.

In this installment, we get to follow Ken and his client, Holly Yee. Her ex-boyfriend and father of her child, Zak Bryant, was killed in a mob hit. Holly and her two friends, Charlotte and Nicole, are now under the protection of Aegis Security until the killer(s) can be caught.

One of the things I enjoy with Leslie North's books is while yes, there is sex in them, it's not over done. These books have substance and aren't just straight smut. There's nothing wrong with straight smut, but it's not my first choice in reading material.\[mfn\]Just a personal preference. I have plenty of friends who love the straight smut romances.\[/mfn\]

I like Holly. She's intelligent, snarky, and funny. She also talks constantly, which I admit, I do as well. I'd most likely have driven Ken bananas myself. I also like Ken, even though he starts out obnoxious as all get out. I probably would have strangled him at some point if I'd been stuck in an apartment with him for weeks on end. I'm just saying.

This book was very fast paced, easy to follow, and didn't really require you to have read the other two books first. Yes, it is a trilogy and you technically should read the books in order, but if you don't, it's not a huge deal. At least not for this trilogy. I'd read the first book, but missed the second book, and I didn't find myself lost or confused in any way. Leslie North's writing style makes her books enjoyable and is one of the reasons I keep going back to her for romance novels when I do want to read one.

I will say, if you're not into romantic suspense or military/ex-military romance novels, you won't be particularly interested in this book or this trilogy. These guys are ex-Navy SEALS and it's mentioned more than once. However, if you're curious about military/ex-military romance novels or romantic suspense novels, I'd say these would be a good start for you.
