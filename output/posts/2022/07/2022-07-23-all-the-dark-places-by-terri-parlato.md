I recently was given the opportunity by Kensington Publishing Corporation, via NetGalley, to read the debut thriller from Terri Parlato, _All the Dark Places_. I have to say, this debut novel is amazing.

First, we have our characters. They're well thought out, well planned, and very well written. Do we get all of the info about each of our characters right away? No. But that actually adds to the intrigue of the book. Something bad happened to Molly as a child. While it'll take a while for you to find out what that is, and you'll want to know, it doesn't detract from the story to find out when you do. No matter what it is, every character with a backstory you need to know will have that backstory told, when the time is right.

This book doesn't beat around the bush. It gets right into the action. That is - the first big event happens within the first chapter. You don't have to wait to find out what the big issue is going to be - it happens immediately. However, that's not the only big issue and all of the big issues are tied together. Which makes this books plot twists all the more satisfying. Believe me, there are several twists. And just when you think you might have figured out who the big bad wolf is, you're probably wrong. I know I was.

This book doesn't read like a debut novel. This book reads like a seasoned novelist wrote the book. Now, is Terri Parlato a pen name for an established writer? Maybe. It wouldn't be the first time that a seasoned author has penned a book under a pen name and it's been listed as a debut novel. But the fact remains that until I looked it up, I had no idea this was the author's debut novel. I even checked on Amazon to make sure it wasn't just a debut novel for a new genre. No... this is the only Terri Parlato novel that Amazon lists. To me, this shows the author's potential to be a big name, very soon.

If you love mysteries and thrillers with lots of plot twists, you definitely want to check this book out. I highly recommend it to all of my mystery/thriller fans and I think it might even be a good one to get started in the genre with.
