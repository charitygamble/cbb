I'm going to be quite honest - this review will be short. I've been trying to keep to using the CAWPILE headings for my reviews, but for this book, I think I'm just going to keep it short and sweet.

_Duplicity_ is a decent book - it earned 3 stars, but it's honestly nothing to write home about. For one thing, we start out with one plot line, then are slapped with a second plot line. We spend the majority of the book working on solving plot line #2, then go back and finish plot line #1 in a hurry. To me it almost felt like Shawn Wilson couldn't figure out what he wanted to actually do with this book, so instead of separating the two plot lines into separate books, which I'd have preferred, he just did them both and hoped for the best.

For me, the characters are just meh. Maybe it was because I hadn't read the first book, but it seemed to me that Brick Kavanaugh, our main character, just wasn't remarkable. None of the characters really were. There just wasn't anything about the characters that made me want to keep reading more books about them.

As far as the plot lines go - I actually enjoyed the second plot line more than the first. I actually wanted to know what was going to happen with plot line #2, while I honestly couldn't have cared less about plot line #1. I'll be honest, I don't honestly know if I'd pick up another Shawn Wilson book.
