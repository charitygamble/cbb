In the early 2000s, I fell in love with a TV show called _Bones_. I would later discover that the TV show was loosely based on the Temperance Brennan series of books by Kathy Reichs. Earlier this year, I decided I was going to make it a point to read/listen to as many of those books as I could. I didn't get too far in, but I knew I had the 20th book in the series, _The Bone Code_, in my NetGalley queue. I finally got off my butt and read it.

First things first, you don't have to read the Temperance Brennan books in order to understand what's going on. You'll be given enough details to help you figure things out if previous books are referenced. So don't let this being the 20th book in the series scare you off. You can totally read this without reading any of the others first.

I love Temperance's character. I find it funny that she isn't nearly as "odd" in the books as she is in the TV show _Bones_. In the show, she doesn't understand pop culture references and is very clinical, doesn't get social cues. In the books, she isn't like that at all. Which is nice because I'm not sure I'd like the books as much as I do if she was. I also enjoy Andrew Ryan's character. He's the perfect foil for Temperance and I love to see all the little tidbits of their relationship.

As for the plot of this particular book, I thought it was very intriguing. A "new" case in the Carolinas is startlingly similar to a 15 year old case from Canada that Temperance and Andrew had worked on. This leads them both down a path filled with danger and surprising revelations. I was kept wondering what would happen next and I absolutely loved the way the plot kept twisting. This book was definitely not boring.

I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It is a mix between a slow-burn and fast-paced. Some areas are slow, some move really fast. The buildup to the final fight scene was well executed. I wasn't left feeling let down by the ending - it was a great ending to a great book.

If you like mystery/thrillers and you like series, I definitely recommend this book and this series.
