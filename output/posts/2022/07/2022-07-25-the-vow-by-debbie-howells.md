After a few false starts, I finally got around to actually reading _The Vow_ by Debbie Howells. When I say I devoured the book, I'm not kidding. I actually stayed up until almost 5:30AM to finish the book. That's how engrossed in the story I was.

I won't lie, the book starts out a little bit on the slow side. The "action" starts right away - the groom-to-be disappears, but after that it just takes a bit for the book to get going. You just have to hang on to get there because once you do... BOOM. It's way faster paced and it's way more intriguing.

You'll get several points of view in this book - Amy, the bride-to-be, Jess - Amy's daughter, Fiona - a character you'll meet later, and then there are the flashbacks to 1996 - where you're never quite sure who is doing the talking, but you know something's going on - and it's not good.

Out of all the characters I think I like Jess the best. While her point of view chapters don't come as often as Amy's or Fiona's, she seems to be the only person who isn't hiding something and who doesn't have a past she wants to forget. Amy and Fiona share a past and they do want to forget it - even if they can't.

The plot twists in this book are **amazing**. While you might see some of them coming, because they're telegraphed and easy to spot, those twists serve to make the ones you don't see coming that much better. For me, the best part was the reveal as to who was actually behind the groom-to-be's disappearance. To say I never saw it coming was an understatement. I'd never in a million years have guessed that - although you do get some setup to it so it isn't just turn the page and BANG - a shocking reveal. But it's set up in a way that makes you question if the characters are correct or not.

This was a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to people who are willing to go with a slow burn mystery to get to a finish that will make you say "never thought of that".
