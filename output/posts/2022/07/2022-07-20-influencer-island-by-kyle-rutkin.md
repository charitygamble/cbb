_Trigger Warnings: Murder, Gore, Sexual Assault, Drugs_

The premise of this book had me wanting to read it and so when I was granted an eARC I was thrilled. However, the book simply didn’t live up to expectations.

First, none of the characters are in any way memorable. The only things I really remember about them are their names - Cal, Carrie, Tuck, Kiana, Bella, Nicki Mo, Trevor, etc.. But who they are, what they stand for? Not much to tell you because they just weren’t memorable to me. We didn’t get a decent enough background for any character to make them pop.

Second, the POV just bounced around too much. Never knowing which point of view you’d get next or what they’d be talking about now didn’t set well with me. I like to have an idea of when point of view changes are coming and what’s going on. It made it a bit hard to keep track of.

Third, the format. I’m not a fan of books that mimic scripts. While this isn’t a script, it is written in a transcript format for a podcast. One chapter = one episode of the podcast. The problem was, the episodes weren’t planned out well. They all seemed to just go with the flow, whatever the characters wanted to discuss at the time. The action scenes were woefully lacking, almost as if they were an afterthought.

The book is OK and it’s a fairly quick read, but I can’t say I’d want to read it a second time. It has potential, but it needs some work to make it a better story.
