When I picked up _When Darkness Falls_ by Kathleen Harryman through NetGalley, I wasn't expecting that the book had already come out in 2017 and had a sequel. While I haven't yet read the sequel, I am going to give my thoughts on the first book.

Our story is being narrated in the first person by a mysterious character whose name we will later learn is Lauren. Lauren has it out for Tracy and wants her gone. Pretty quickly into the book I deduced what was going on with Lauren and Tracy - which I will not be spoiling for you - although I had to wait until the end of the book to find out that I'd been correct the entire time.

The characters are interesting enough - I felt Lauren was the most interesting of the bunch, with the others there merely as window dressing to help the story along. Even Tracy wasn't much more than window dressing to me, but I feel as though that was to help convey part of the reason Lauren hated her so much.

I did find the book to have some unbelievable characteristics - for example, someone suspected of murder who was still working at their job. Most employers, even if a formal accusation had not been made, wouldn't permit a suspect to remain employed by their establishment. However, the book does appear to be set in the UK, so perhaps that is why.

I felt the ending to be somewhat lacking. Yes, it gave us the "big reveal" but to me, the epilogue basically ruined it. I felt the information we gleaned in the epilogue would have made a better prologue to the second book, allowing us to think all was well until we started the second book. However, I didn't feel it was a big enough issue to detract from the book. I flew through the book once I started reading it. It was a fast paced book with enough action to keep you wondering who was going to be the next person found dead.

I'd recommend this book for those who are looking to get into psychological thrillers.
