Most people probably don't know this, because I don't make it as obvious as I \*could\*, but I am a huge fan of _The Nightmare Before Christmas_. It is easily my favorite movie of all time. So when I see there are "sequels" to it, I have to try my best to read them. Or in this case, listen to them.

Now, one reason why it's taken so long for any sequels for _The Nightmare Before Christmas_ to come out is because Tim Burton didn't really want any. He was afraid that it would become a big thing with people going through the other doors and he just didn't want that. At least that's what I've heard - who knows?

Well, if the above reasoning is true, then he'd be sorely disappointed in _Long Live the Pumpkin Queen_ - because there's a lot of going through the other doors. Granted, the point isn't the other realms, it's just there is a lot of going through other doors into other realms involved here. There's also the complete destruction of Sally's backstory - which I'm not going to get into in depth, but let's just say, it's kind of startling.

I honestly didn't care for _Long Live the Pumpkin Queen_. The story takes our headstrong Sally and turns her into an insecure waif who is whiny and terrified to become the Pumpkin Queen. It takes nearly the entire story for us to get the Sally we know and love back and frankly, I found it annoying. I can't see Sally going from the girl who went to try to save "Sandy Claws" from Oogie Boogie on her own acting the way she does for the first third-to-one-half of this book. This isn't the Sally we know or love and it just irks me.

The story itself was interesting enough, but I just couldn't get past some things that happened that made certain characters you'll meet no better than Dr. Finkelstein. There's a lot that just didn't fit well with the original story and I'm just not here for it.

The narration was pretty good, although the narrator didn't quite nail Sally's voice. The narration had nothing to do with my dislike of the book - that was solely in the storyline.

Bottomline, if you don't mind an almost complete personality change on Sally's part, I'd say go ahead and read/listen to this. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother with it.
