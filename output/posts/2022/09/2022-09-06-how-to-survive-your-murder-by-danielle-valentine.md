CW: Murder, Gore, Death

If there is one thing I can honestly say about "How to Survive Your Murder" it's that while it isn't a totally unique concept, the execution is pretty amazing.

The reason I say the concept isn't totally unique is that it has the "going back in time to fix things" trope - something found in books like "Again, But Better". I know some people don't care for that particular trope, but I don't mind it if it's done right. Trust me when I say it's done right in this book.

One of my favorite things about this book is the main character - she's a horror-movie loving nerd, an expert on Final Girls. Thrown back in time to try to figure out who the real killer was and maybe save her sister, she runs up against some very interesting twists and turns.

This is one of those books where you'll come to a point and say "I know who did it!" but trust me, you don't. You absolutely don't. Not until it's time for the final reveal and then you'll know. Danielle Valentine knows how to keep the suspense going and how to put in enough twists and turns that you're never quite sure what's going on or who did the deed.

I highly recommend this book for mystery/thriller/horror fans who like to be kept guessing and love to have lots of twists and turns in their books.
