Ok, you all had to know this was coming. I'm part of Amy Kaybach's ARC Team, so the chances of me not reviewing Blind Rebels book 3 was slim to none. Well, today is this book's birthday, so here we are - my review of _Reviving the Rhythm_.

This time we get Sammy's love story and in this case, it's a love he had and lost... of his own doing. There are things in this book that hit home for me and it took me a bit longer to read this one than the first two books.

First, let's look at our characters. Of course, we already know the lovable Sammy. He's the peacemaker and peacekeeper in the band. He's a fun-loving guy and he's great with Gibson. We get to learn Sammy's backstory and what made him who he is today. We also learn about the tragedies in his life. Those tragedies aren't entirely his alone - he shares at least one with Killian.

Then we have Melody. Sammy's long lost love - again, of his own doing. She's a great character. She's strong, but also not strong in certain situations. She also has situations in which she reacts like many of us would or do. I really liked her, although I admit, I like Kady and Ari better... again, I love Melody, but I just like Kady and Ari better for some reason.

Next we have Clance and Sofie... they're a married couple who are friends of Melody's. Clance is overprotective of Melody and in some cases it is warranted, in others, not so much. Clance features more in the book than Sofie does - but we do see her a fair amount and she's a good friend to Melody.

Now, let's look at our plot - this one is full of twists, turns, and near-tragedies. It kept my interest and made me want to read more, as all of Amy's books have. The only reason I had issues was there are a few things that hit home for me because while my issues aren't exactly the same, I have some similar problems as characters in the book\[mfn\]All I will say is one of the characters is Killian and one is Melody\[/mfn\]. But the plot is amazing in this one and I'm impressed at Amy's coming up with new ways for her couples to have problems. LOL

The ending was perfect and not perfect as it is kind of a cliffhanger, but not really. It's a cliffhanger for reasons... but it's not as far as Sammy and Melody's story goes. The cliffhanger involves our 4th Blind Rebel, Killian. But I'm not telling you what it is. Suffice it to say, you'll be chomping at the bit for Killian's book and the explanation for his part of the ending of _Reviving the Rhythm_.

I gave this one 5 stars because as always, Amy does an amazing job with the Blind Rebel boys. I highly recommend you give these books a try - start with Bridging the Silences, then go to Blending Chords, then Reviving the Rhythm. I promise you won't be sorry.
