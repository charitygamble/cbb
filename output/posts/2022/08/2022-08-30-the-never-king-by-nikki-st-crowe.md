If you're looking for a Peter Pan retelling that is full of angst and is **_spicy_**, I'd recommend picking up _The Never King_\[mfn\]And its sequels\[/mfn\] by Nikki St. Crowe. Holy cow...

In all honesty, I couldn't tell you what attracted me to _The Never King_ other than the cover. I saw it on KindleUnlimited and borrowed it because it looked cool. I definitely wasn't expecting a spicy, angsty retelling of Peter Pan. But let me tell you, I couldn't put the book down after I started reading it! I literally read all 192 pages in one afternoon, on my phone. Yes, on my **phone**.

I have to say, I love the characters in this book. I adore the twins - Bash and Kas, I love Vane, I love Peter Pan, and I adore Winnie. Vane is such an interesting character to me with his dark, twisted background. The twins are so sweet and kind - even if Bash wants to pretend he isn't. Peter Pan made me wish I was Winnie from the very get go. And Winnie, our resident Darling, is far different from anything you're probably thinking she is.

Most of the time when I find books like this, they're lacking in plot. This one wasn't, which I was grateful for. I tend to shy away from spicy books and books that feature polyamory because, honestly, a lot of them are two chapters of plot and twenty chapters of spice. But _The Never King_ mixes the plot with the spice well and doesn't overdo the spice like a lot of books I've read.

You start to see hints of romance in this book, but I'm feeling like the majority will be in the sequels to _The Never King_. You do get the very distinct impression that there are feelings being caught all around, so that's interesting. I can't wait to read the other two books and see where all of this romance and polyamory goes.

If you're new to dark romance, dark fantasy, polyamory in books, or spicy books, I think this one would be a good introduction to these genres/subgenres. I also think that anyone who is a die-hard fan of these types of books would like this as well. However, if you don't like sex in your books or you don't like polyamory, don't bother picking this up, you'll probably hate it. Just saying.
