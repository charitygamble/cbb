I first stepped into the world of Krynn - and Dragonlance, in 2002 with _The Legend of Huma_. I was working at a little used bookstore in Texas and had noticed that the small rack of Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books we had got a lot of attention - and purchases. I enjoyed _The Legend of Huma_ greatly and set out to read more books. My friend suggested reading _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_. So I obtained a copy and tried. I got less than 1/4 of the way through it and stopped reading. Then I picked it up a few months later, got about 1/4 of the way through it and stopped reading. I did this several times over the years. Finally, my friend who suggested reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight all those years ago, who is now my roommate, brought me the book\[mfn\]He actually brought me the first 8 books recommended in the reading order on Witty & Sarcastic Book Club's post, and he hadn't read the post!\[/mfn\] this past Friday and told me I needed to read it. So I did. And I finished it this time.

Now I can't understand why it took me so darned long to read it! I love the characters, I love the world, I love everything about it. I think my favorite character has to be Tasselhof Burrfoot, although I have to say Flint Fireforge and Fizban are up there too. Tas is so funny - always mysteriously finding other people's belongings in with his, getting himself into awkward or bad situations. Flint is hilarious - especially his commentary on gully dwarves. And Fizban - I've never seen a more daft mage... he literally fights with trees. It's utterly hilarious and you have to read about it to truly understand how hilarious it is.

I love the world of Krynn. I love the dragons\[mfn\]Even though all we've gotten so far are "bad" dragons.\[/mfn\]. One dragon in particular tugged at my heartstrings even though she's technically a "bad" dragon. Personally I don't think any of them are "bad", just misguided and misunderstood. But that's just me. I love dragons period.

The plot had enough plot points to keep things interesting and I appreciate that the book, even though it is part of a series, doesn't end on a cliffhanger, nor does it end in an abrupt manner. It even ends on a happy note even though the struggle isn't finished. It's a satisfying ending and I enjoyed it very much.

Now, as to why it took me so long to read this book? I think in a lot of ways it has to do with the fact that I didn't play D&D back then. Now that I do, I can appreciate the world, I can appreciate the stories and the plotlines that are going on. It's like reading a D&D campaign without having to roll dice or decide what I'm going to do. I can just sit back and watch the characters handle their business on their own. That being said, if you don't have an interest in D&D, you might not understand the books and you might find yourself on the bored side while reading them.

If you like fantasy and you like D&D\[mfn\]Or Pathfinder as 1st edition for Pathfinder was based on the rule set for D&D 3.5.\[/mfn\] I'm sure you'll love the Dragonlance books. Even if you aren't, give them a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.
