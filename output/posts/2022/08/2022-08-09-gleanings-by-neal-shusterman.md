A couple of years ago, I read and reviewed the _Arc of a Scythe_ trilogy by Neal Shusterman. I absolutely loved the trilogy and gave it high marks here on the blog. Well, the other day as I was trolling through NetGalley, I noticed a new book by Neal Shusterman and the cover reminded me a lot of the _Arc of a Scythe_ trilogy. Then I noticed the title - _Gleanings_. That was all I needed to see to know there was a new _Arc of a Scythe_ book coming out. I requested it and was granted my request to read and review the book.

_Gleanings_ is a collection of short stories that take place at various points in time during the _Arc of a Scythe_ trilogy. In some cases, it gives some backstory - such as for Scythe Curie and Scythe Goddard. In other cases it tells what happened after the end of _The Toll_. And in still other cases, it gives some insight into the Scythes and their various personalities, squabbles amongst each other, and relationships with other people such as family or pets.

It was nice to revisit some old friends and enemies in the Scythedom, as well as to make some new acquaintances. I will say this - you will want to read this book last. Read the original trilogy first, then read _Gleanings_. This is because there are some spoilers in these short stories - which is fine because they're meant to be read after the original trilogy.

_Gleanings_ has stories that are written by Neal Shusterman as well as having co-authors like David Yoon and Michael H. Payne on some of the stories. All of the stories are very well written and fit in perfectly with the writing style shown in the original trilogy. You won't be able to tell a difference between the co-authored stories and the ones Neal Shusterman wrote on his own - which is a good thing. I'm usually not a fan of co-authored stories, because often the writing styles don't blend well. That isn't the case here and I'm super happy about that.

If you've read the original trilogy and are hungering for more of the Scythedom world - I highly recommend you check out _Gleanings_. You won't be disappointed.
