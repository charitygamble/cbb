For those who don't know, I'm a vegetarian. I tend to eat quite a bit of vegan food because if it's vegan, then I know I can eat it. I'm always looking for good substitutes for some of my old favorite dishes - like roast beef and pepperoni pizza. Finding _The Herbivorous Butcher Cookbook_ gives me a chance to find those dishes and make them myself without paying an arm and a leg for a premade version.

This cookbook has some amazing, mouthwatering recipes in it. Some of the options include pepperoni, porterhouse steaks, a beef roast, spam, chicken cutlets, and more - all vegan. This cookbook doesn't just show you how to make the meat substitutes though. Oh no, this cookbook also tells you what things you can do with them as well! Recipes like fried chicken sandwiches and philly cheesesteak sandwiches - again, all vegan.

My favorites out of the meat substitutes were the pepperoni and the beef roast. I also really enjoyed the chicken cutlets. We like to make chicken sandwiches around our house, but I'm often left out if I haven't purchased a bag of chick'n filets lately. Not anymore. I can grab some ingredients from the pantry and make chicken cutlets for myself.

The recipes in this cookbook are well written and easy to follow. You may find that you'll be making some purchases from online retailers for items that may not be available in your area such as red beet powder, mushroom powder, or a dedicated steamer appliance for the kitchen, but most of the items are easily found in local stores.

The photography in this cookbook is stunning, giving a clear picture of what you can expect when you make these recipes. Of course, yours will never look as good as the professional's did, but hey, that's half the fun, isn't it?

I highly recommend this cookbook to anyone who is vegetarian, vegan, or looking to reduce their animal consumption, but doesn't want to buy premade meat substitutes.
