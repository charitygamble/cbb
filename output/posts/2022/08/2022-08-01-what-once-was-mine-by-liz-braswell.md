If you've read my blog for any length of time, you know that I absolutely LOVE Disney's Twisted Tales. I just love how they take a beloved story and turn it around, giving it a new life. So when I saw _What Once Was Mine_ on NetGalley, I knew I had to request it. I just wish it had met my expectations.

## What Once Was Mine Review

This is the first time I haven't particularly cared for one of the Twisted Tales books. I've loved every other book I've read from the series and I own about half of the series. But for some reason this one just didn't give me the same happy feeling I had with the other ones.

I am thinking that the reason for this is that _What Once Was Mine_ has a different format to how the story is laid out. Instead of just starting from the beginning of the actual Disney version of the story, this one starts out in the "real" world. In this Twisted Tale, the twisted version of the tale is being told to a girl by her twin brother. I don't think this would have bothered me quite as much if it weren't for the fact that the girl will occasionally interject and disrupt the flow of the story. While I understand this meant to help convey the fact that the story is being told to her, it is rather annoying to have the flow of the story just interrupted.

Other than that, I found the story to be rather boring. It just wasn't holding my interest and it took me a while to actually read the book. I couldn't get behind the characters and the plot just wasn't doing it for me.

I'll buy it to complete my collection but I doubt I'd re-read it any time soon. Maybe if I re-read it in the future I'll like it more, but right now, it's a 3 star for me.
