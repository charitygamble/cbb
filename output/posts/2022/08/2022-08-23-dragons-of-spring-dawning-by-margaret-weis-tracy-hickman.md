Oh come on, you couldn't have thought I'd review _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ and _Dragons of Winter Night_ but fail to review _Dragons of Spring Dawning_ could you? Good, because if you'd thought I wouldn't review the third book in the Chronicles quartet, you'd have been wrong.

Once again, we have death and betrayal in this book, so if you're looking for those things, you'll want to pick this book up. But again, read _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ and _Dragons of Winter Night_ first. Trust me, you'll thank me later if you do.

First we need to add a bit of direction - before you read DoSD get some tissues. Especially if you have already read DoAT and DoWN. Trust me, you'll need them. Just get them. If you don't cry, I swear, you've either read the books 100 times before and know what to expect, or you're one of those people who aren't moved by the death of a beloved character. No, I'm not going to tell you which one. No, I won't tell you when it happens. You'll have to read the book to find that out. But for the love of chickens, get some tissues!

There is betrayal in this book, but it isn't exactly what you think. It's betrayal and it's not betrayal, which I know, doesn't make any sense at all. But it's the truth. Again, not giving you any details. I couldn't begin to describe it even if I was willing to give details. It is definitely one of those "you have to read it to understand it" things. But you do still have betrayals in this book.

There are several things in this book that you absolutely will not understand if you have not read _Dragons of Winter Night_ because there are several things that refer back to the happenings in that book. This book definitely requires it's forebears to be read first.

Once again, the writing and world building are of the highest quality. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman make an exquisite writing team - they truly love the world of Krynn and the stories they've created and it shows in the books they've written. I'm honestly not sure how anyone who loves fantasy wouldn't fall in love with Krynn, our faithful companions, and the stories in which they are featured - unless of course you don't like epic fantasy, dragons, or misfit heroes.

I know I've been giving the books five stars all along, but it's so difficult not to - they are stunning books and honestly, I can't imagine them having less than a five star rating - at least not from me. These are easily some of my favorite books I've read this year and _Dragons of Spring Dawning_ was no exception. I will never cease to recommend these books to anyone who loves fantasy or Dungeons & Dragons.
