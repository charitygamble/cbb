I have to say, if you're looking for a fantasy book with suspense, intrigue, death, and betrayal, you'd do well to pick up _Dragons of Winter Night_ by Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman.\[mfn\]Just make sure to read _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ first, as _Dragons of Winter Night_ is the second book in the series.\[/mfn\]

First things first - be aware that when you start _Dragons of Winter Night_, you'll be starting about a month after the ending of _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_, and in kind of an awkward spot as you'll have little idea of what's going on because the companions have gone on an adventure that we don't get to read about.\[mfn\]I'm hoping that a later book might include it, even though that'd make no sense. You never know.\[/mfn\]

There's a lot of suspense and intrigue in this middle book in the series.\[mfn\]I say series because _Dragonlance Chronicles_ includes four books, although you generally don't read the fourth book until much later in the recommended reading order - there are four books to read between _Dragons of Spring Dawning_ and _Dragons of Summer Flame_ in the [recommended reading order](https://wittyandsarcasticbookclub.home.blog/2022/08/02/dragonlance-reading-order-2022/).\[/mfn\] We meet a new character who becomes one of the companions of sorts, but there are reasons not to trust this new character. The newbie also has a secret, that will be revealed in due time.\[mfn\]Just a note, I actually guessed the secret long before it was revealed, but I think that's just because I'd paid attention to some of the stories/legends told about before the Cataclysm.\[/mfn\] You'll also get the chance to meet an old friend again - one who we last saw in _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_.

As for the betrayal portion, there's a good portion of that. From family betrayals to betrayals from friends, this book has its fair share of betrayal. I'm not sure which betrayal - the family or the friend betrayal hurts worse. Personally, the more surprising one was the friend betrayal. I'm obviously not going to give spoilers but I'm pretty sure if you've read this book before, then you already know what I'm talking about. The family betrayal goes on both sides of the family coin, with some betrayals worse than others. They're no less heart-wrenching though.

Don't get me started on how heart-and-gut-wrenching the death you'll experience in this book is. I needed tissues - I'm becoming too attached to our noble companions. I won't tell you who it is, but I will tell you that you've been with this character since DoAT and will likely either be very upset or even cry like I did when it happens.

All of this is beautifully written. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have their writing down to an art. Their passages blend seamlessly with each other's - unless the authors themselves were to tell me who wrote what passage, I'd never be able to tell you. They also have the world of Krynn down to an art and a science - everything flows well, works well, and makes sense. They've built a world around _Dungeons & Dragons_ that is mesmerizing, horrifying, and wonderful all at the same time.

If you're new to fantasy or _Dragonlance_, start with _Dragons of Autumn Twilight_ - it's the first book in the _Dragonlance Chronicles_ series. If you've already read it, go ahead and read _Dragons of Winter Night_. Trust me, you won't want to miss this book because I've already started _Dragons of Spring Dawning_ and you won't understand what's happening at all if you haven't read _Dragons of Winter Night_ first.

This is another five star read from the Dragonlance world and I can't wait to read more.
