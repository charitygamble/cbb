Today I'm bringing you a review of **Hatchet Girls** by Diana Rodriguez Wallach, a Young Adult Horror novel that has ties to the Lizzie Borden axe murders of 1892. This post is part of the [TBR & Beyond Tours blog tour](https://tbrandbeyondtours.com/2023/09/01/tour-schedule-hatchet-girls-by-diana-rodriguez-wallach/).

I'm going to be honest - while I did enjoy **Hatchet Girls**, I'm not going to say it was my favorite read of 2023 by any means. The characters were good, some had more background than others, and in some cases, I think some of the characters could have used a bit more background.

The plot was pretty unique and I really enjoyed it, as well as the writing style in the book. Unfortunately, I guessed the "bad guy" way too early in the book and it kind of spoiled the book for me because of that. However, I did enjoy the way the book ends because it was pretty cool.

All in all, I gave the book 3.5 stars because to be perfectly honest, while it was a pretty good read and worked well for Spooky Season, it just wasn't a favorite of mine.
