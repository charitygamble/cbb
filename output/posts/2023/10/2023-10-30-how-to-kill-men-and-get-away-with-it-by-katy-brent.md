Another book sent to me by my contact at HarperCollins is **How to Kill Men and Get Away With It** by Katy Brent. The cover made me laugh because at the very bottom it says "For legal purposes: a novel".

## Characters

Kitty reminds me a lot of me. She's vegan and she doesn't care much for human beings for the most part. Oh she loves her friends, but that's about it. Otherwise, she seems to find dealing with other people exhausting. I quite concur with her on that. However, I don't share her penchant for murder.

Hen strikes me as just there for the most part. It's almost like she's the part of the friend group that is simply there for the purpose of providing parties and the like. Nothing particularly special about her, but I didn't really care much for her either.

Maisie is an airhead of the highest order. She's pretty much the vapid, stupid one of the group, but is also rather sweet and at least more cordial that Hen seems to be. I liked her well enough, although we don't see all that much of her.

Tor is probably the friend we see the most of and I love her character. She's sweet and she's Kitty's best friend despite Kitty not being a huge people person. Tor has her own issues and I think that's why she and Kitty get along so well.

Charlie is an interesting character - he's in love with Kitty, so there's that. We don't see much of him that isn't related to something going on with Kitty. He's a nice enough fellow and I like him well enough.

## Atmosphere

I kind of like the atmosphere for this book. It's actually quite normal - it isn't creepy, it isn't weird, it isn't dark. It is just normal London. It makes for an interesting read because so many mystery/thriller novels will try to make the atmosphere creepy, but this is just.... normal.

## Writing

I like Katy Brent's writing style. It is easy to read, easy to follow along with, and makes reading the book a breeze. While I can't say that I understood all of the British lingo (I'm American), I don't think she really used enough British lingo to actually make it difficult to read the book. I'd be willing to read more of Katy Brent's work.

## Plot

This one had an interesting plot to it. Having a murderer who does so for a specific reason but who also has to deal with a stalker is quite the interesting plot. And the twists are perfection - trust me, you'll never guess who the stalker is!

## Intrigue

Honestly, a book has to have intrigue to be a proper mystery/thriller novel and this one has it. It isn't who is committing the murders - we know that. But the intrigue is what other secrets does Kitty have and who on earth in her stalker? The intrigue here is more subtle than most books because usually a mystery/thriller is all about who is killing the murder victims. But in this case, we have a different focus for the intrigue.

## Romance

I think the romance between Kitty and Charlie is very sweet. It's a bit rocky for a while, but it is very sweet. I liked it a lot. Not so much Maisie and Rupert's romance, although some of the descriptions for it made me laugh out loud. It's just enough romance to have something soft and not so much that it should be a romance novel instead.

## Ending

The ending to this one contains a plot twist that you won't see coming. It involves Kitty's stalker and trust me, you'll be surprised when you find out who it is. Or maybe not... anything is possible. I did enjoy the ending though because it seems like everyone got what they deserved.

## Conclusion

All in all this one was a good book and I would recommend it to those looking for a mystery/thriller that is a little bit different. I gave this one 4 out of 5 stars. I will definitely check out Katy Brent's future works.
