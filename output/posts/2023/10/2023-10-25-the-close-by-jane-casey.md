By now we should all know that if a book is a horror, thriller, or mystery, I'm probably going to want to read it. So when HarperCollins reached out and asked if I'd like to read **The Close** by Jane Casey, I said yes pretty quickly. Thank you to HarperCollins for sending me this book and facilitating my honest review.

## Characters

The Close has an interesting cast of characters, beginning with Maeve Kerrigan. I admit, I do quite like our main character and I love the leading man, Josh Derwent as well. They're well written and even though this was my first encounter with them, I found myself full immersed in their story.

As for characters that should be unique to this particular book, my annoyance with Rhys Vonn has rarely been matched with other characters. Trust me when I say, he's an ass. Not overly fond of Mike Knox, Tom Thwaites, or Brian\[mfn\]I don't remember his last name and don't feel like getting up to get the book lol\[/mfn\] either.

All in all, great characters that have enough background to keep you going. And special shoutout to Pippin... you'll figure it out when you read it.

## Atmosphere

I like the tiny suburb feel of the book. I don't live in England and have never been to England, so I'm not sure if Jellicoe Close is meant to be a suburb, a tiny town, or just a neighborhood. But I love the setting so much. I love that it feels like one of those close-knit neighborhoods where everyone knows everyone, everyone gets along as well as they can, and everyone has a great time together. But it also has the feeling of being creepy, especially when an unknown person seems to be watching everything the neighborhood does. It's great!

## Writing

I really enjoy Jane Casey's writing style. It is well paced, easy to read, and entertaining. I'm looking forward to finding and reading the first 9 books in the Maeve Kerrigan series and hoping there will be an 11th and beyond.

## Plot

I really liked this plot. Posing as a couple to spy on one house because there may be wrongdoing going on, working a prior murder case at the same time, and then stumbling into even more trouble than they thought is a lot, and it works. It works very well. This plot kept me wanting to read more.

## Intrigue

Well, it is a mystery/suspense/thriller novel, so obviously there is going to be intrigue! And it will keep you wanting more of it. Who is this mysterious lurker, whose thoughts we occasionally get to read? What is going on at number 7 in Jellicoe Close? What other secrets are the residents of Jellicoe Close hiding?

## Romance

I know, it's a mystery/suspense/thriller. But there is romance. There's definitely a spark between Miss Kerrigan and Mr. Derwent. Even if they don't really understand it yet and even if they don't know what, if anything, they want to do about it. It's very interesting and I want to know more. Again, hoping for more books...although leaving this budding romance this way makes me think there will be.

## Ending

The book's ending was a surprise but also quite satisfying. All of our cases have been wrapped up neatly and there are no strings hanging - except that pesky budding romance, of course. But this was a seriously great ending.

## Conclusion

I gave this one 4.5 stars because it is truly a great read. It kept me on my toes and made me want to read the rest of the series, plus any that come out later on. I highly recommend it to my thriller lovers, especially if you like thrillers set in England.
