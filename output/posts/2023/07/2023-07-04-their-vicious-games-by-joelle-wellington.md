**Their Vicious Games** is nothing short of amazing. Think **Squid Games** meets **The Hunger Games** but in this case, the stakes are more than you might think.

I'm going to say this now, Adina and Saint have my heart for the female characters. They're strong, resilient, and while they may take crap at the beginning of The Finish, the certainly won't take it forever. As far as the male characters go, the only one we see a lot of in the story that I actually like is Graham. He may be misguided and blinded by his love for Pierce, but he also appears to truly care about Adina at the very least. The rest of the characters honestly made me want to reach through the pages and slap them a few times. And can someone please tell me how you're supposed to pronounce Penthesilea's name?

This story had a very interesting plot going. You were never quite sure what would happen next - what was each portion of The Finish going to be? What would happen during it? Who would die? Because let's face it, if you've read the synopsis, you know someone is likely going to die. But the plot is executed in a manner that just blew me away. Part of that plot involves racism and classism, so be aware of that.

The writing style is awesome. Fast paced, easy to read, not too dry and not too flowery. This was exactly what a thriller version of **The Hunger Games/Squid Games** should be. I wouldn't change a thing about Joelle Wellington's writing style.

Now let's discuss the ending. It was brilliant. I never would have seen it coming and but it is completely understandable. But who all lives and who all dies? Well, I'm not going to tell you that. But you'll be surprised at who lives... because some of them you wouldn't expect to make it.

If you're looking for a YA Mystery/Thriller that borders on horror\[mfn\]Personally, I would classify this as horror.\[/mfn\], I highly suggest Their Vicious Games. This was a thrilling 5 star read and one that I hope to reread.

As a note - I'd love a "prequel" to this - perhaps the story behind it actually being started by the Remington ancestor who founded The Finish? I mean, I'd love to know if The Finish we read about in **Their Vicious Games** was The Finish the founder intended.
