I've been following Brandon Baker for quite a while on social media - most notably TikTok and Instagram. So I was thrilled to find out that he'd written books, especially horror/thriller books. So of course, when I got KindleUnlimited back, I had to read them.

While I will admit I didn't feel a big connection to any of the characters in this book, that isn't uncommon for me with horror genre novels. For some reason I just don't tend to get attached to or connect with most horror novel characters - probably because I figure they'll die at some point. But the characters in this book had fairly decent backstories. Obviously this being a novella the characters couldn't have too elaborate backstories, but I think the backstories were sufficient for the needs of the story.

The plot for **Whatever Remains of Us in the End** is a bit convoluted, but again, it's a horror novella. I've seen full-length horror novels with more convoluted plots - and they were much harder to follow that this was. I had no trouble following the plot at all. I liked the twists that came up and was pleasantly surprised at the ending - I'd almost like to see a sequel because I think it would be fun.

Just a note: this is only Brandon's second published work. So obviously you might not find it OMG AMAZING but I truly think you can see the talent Brandon has. Most authors don't have the greatest first few published works. It's just the way writing is.

This is a great novella that would make a good entry point into horror - it isn't as scary as some horror novels/novellas are, but it gives a good idea of what you can find in horror novels. I gave it 4/5 stars because there's always room for improvement but this was a great novella for a second published work.
