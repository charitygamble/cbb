I bought **House of Salt and Sorrows** when it first came out and started reading it right away. But I didn't finish it. I started reading it again a few months later, but again, didn't finish it. Finally, after finding out that **House of Roots and Ruin**, the sequel to **House of Salt and Sorrows**, was coming out, I got off my butt and read it.

I have no idea why on Earth it took me so long to read this book. Part of it might have been because I'm actually not familiar with the fairy tale of the **Twelve Dancing Princesses**, of which **House of Salt and Sorrows** is a retelling. But whatever the reason, it absolutely shouldn't have taken me this long to read this book!

I loved Annaleigh! She's strong but also shows vulnerability, especially when certain events take place. I also loved most of her sisters - Camille wasn't my favorite, but I did enjoy the triplets and the Graces. They were fun characters. Not particularly sure how I felt about their father and I really wasn't fond of Morella, their step-mother. But I did quite enjoy Cassius.

I'm a huge fairy tale retelling lover, so it isn't a surprise that I loved this one. Even though I wasn't particularly familiar with the fairy tale HOSAS was based on, a quick Google search told me all I needed to know about the original tale. I loved the way Erin A. Craig wove the story around the idea of the Thaumas sisters being cursed because of the deaths of so many of them.

There were several plot twists that I didn't see coming and that I highly doubt most readers would be able to guess. Especially the big twist at towards the end - that one was definitely not expected! It truly was a great twist!

I really love the ending - mostly because I was so sad at one of the smaller plot twists revealed towards the end of the book. It was the perfect way to end HOSAS and I am looking forward the **House of Roots and Ruin**.

This one got 4.5/5 stars from me and I highly recommend this book for those who love fairy tales and fairy tale retellings.
