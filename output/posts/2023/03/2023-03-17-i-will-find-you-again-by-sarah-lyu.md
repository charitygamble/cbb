## I Will Find You Again - Characters

There are three characters I'm going to go over here - Chase, Lia, and Hunter. There are other characters, but they're more background/side characters than anything else, so I won't detail them here\[mfn\]If I did, this post might not ever end LOL\[/mfn\].

### Chase

The first character from **I Will Find You Again** I'm going to talk about is Chase. Chase is our main character and the character from whose point of view we are being told the story. I'm not sure what to think of Chase. She reminds me a lot of Spencer from **Pretty Little Liars** - you know, the overachiever who keeps chugging along because it is what is expected of her. She's got to be perfect, got to make the grades, etc.. But while I liked Spencer, I don't know how I feel about Chase. She's a good main character, I'm just not sure if I like her.

### Lia

We don't see much of Lia, but that's OK. We learn enough about her over the course of the book to figure out whether or not we like her. Again, as with Chase, I'm not sure that I particularly care for Lia. She seems a bit on the whiny side - "look at me, I appear to have this great home life but it really sucks" kind of girl and that just bugs me. She was Chase's best friend & her girlfriend. I like Chase better than I like Lia.

### Hunter

Hunter is an interesting character and honestly, I think she's the character that really makes **I Will Find You Again** what it is. This might sound odd, especially once you've read the book and understand who Hunter really is, but of the three main female characters, Hunter is my favorite. She is also a girlfriend of Lia's... sort of. You'll have to read the book to understand.

## I Will Find You Again - Atmosphere

So the atmosphere in **I Will Find You Again** is basically just a run of the mill, upper-class community. There's nothing particularly ominous about the town. Montauk will become a bit more ominous as the book goes on, but it isn't at first. I think the most interesting thing about the atmosphere of this book is that it really isn't creepy, ominous, or anything else you'd expect from a mystery/thriller novel, but it works. So I give it points for that because it absolutely works.

## I Will Find You Again - Writing

I have to say, I very much enjoyed Sarah Lyu's writing style in **I Will Find You Again**. It keeps the book moving, quickly but not too quickly, and it is easy to read and understand. You won't be asking yourself what's going on all the time because it's not hard to keep up. Will there be times you're a bit confused? Sure, but it is done in a way that is meant to set things up for later. So trust me when I say that if you are having trouble following the story, it'll be explained later.

## I Will Find You Again - Plot

This book has a plot that is absolute genius. I can't really say much of anything about it without giving it away, but just let me say this - you won't expect the twist that comes up, because I sure didn't and I'm usually pretty good about figuring out what's going to happen next.

## I Will Find You Again - Intrigue

Being a mystery/thriller novel, **I Will Find You Again** would need to have some intrigue to it. And it does. Boy does it ever have intrigue. Trying to figure out what really happened to Lia is what will keep you reading this book. You'll become invested in this mystery as Chase and Hunter try to figure all of this out. And again, you won't see the plot twist coming!

## I Will Find You Again - Logic

It's a mystery/thriller. There is logic there, but it might be hard to spot at first. Things in this book don't happen in a logical, chronological order because you need to bounce around to get to where you need to go.

## I Will Find You Again - Ending

The ending to **I Will Find You Again** was satisfying. It didn't leave more questions than answers and it didn't leave anything open for a sequel because this book doesn't need one\[mfn\]Unlike a book I reviewed a few months ago that is a standalone but I feel should have gotten a sequel.\[/mfn\]. I quite liked the ending myself.

## Conclusion

**I Will Find You Again** by Sarah Lyu is a four-star read that will keep you entertained and wondering what's going to happen next. I highly recommend this book to any fan of mystery/thriller novels, especially YA mystery/thriller novels.
