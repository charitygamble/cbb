When I read the description/synopsis of this book, I knew I had to do a review of it. It just sounded like it was going to be so good! I wasn't wrong.

First, I love that main characters have a YouTube channel that is basically urban exploration with a twist - they break into various places that are abandoned, condemned, or just closed up at the moment for a behind-the-scenes look. I'm a fan of channels like that on YouTube myself, so that was cool.

Another thing I was in love with was the constant twists and turns. Just when I thought I'd figured out who might have attacked Jacob, I was wrong - and it turns out I never did guess the right person! There are also other twists, turns, and revelations that kept me on my toes and the edge of my seat.

Most of the story is told from Casey's point of view, although some of it is told from Jacob's point of view. You also get some newspaper/gossip rag articles and personal correspondence of Rosalinda Valentini's. The newspaper/gossip rag articles are interesting and while Rosalinda's correspondence might seem unnecessary at first, trust me, they're there for a good reason.

I also like that there is queer representation, but that while it does figure into the story, it doesn't do so in any way you might expect and it doesn't overshadow the main storyline.

I gave this book 5 stars because the plot twists were amazing, the story was extremely well written, and honestly, I read this book in two sittings. It's a great book and I highly recommend it!
