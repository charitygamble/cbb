Today I'm featuring a review of **When Oceans Rise** by Robin Alvarez. This review is part of my stop on the blog tour organized by [TBR & Beyond Tours](https://tbrandbeyondtours.com/2023/04/08/tour-schedule-when-oceans-rise-by-robin-alvarez/).

For some reason when I started reading **When Oceans Rise**, I didn't realize it was a **Little Mermaid** retelling - until certain things happened and my brain said "Oh, ok! **Little Mermaid** retelling!" Just add a little bit of spice... such as Filipino mythology, monsters, and gods.

Now we all know by now that I'm a fan of fairy tale retellings, so it shouldn't be a surprise that I liked this one. Although I wasn't as fond of it as I have been with other retellings, that's more because I'm not as big of a fan of the **Little Mermaid** as I am other fairy tales than it is anything to do with the actual book.

As far as the characters are concerned, I liked Malaya, Gabrielle, and Salvador. I wasn't as fond of the other characters, although I did kind of like Tita Blessica as well. I felt the book was well written, I just wasn't really caring too much for the **Little Mermaid** aspects of the book. However, I know that the book wouldn't have worked using any other fairy tale.

I gave the book 3.5 stars because while it was good and it was well written, it wasn't my personal favorite.
