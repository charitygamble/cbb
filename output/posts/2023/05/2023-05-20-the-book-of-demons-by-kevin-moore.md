I'm going to admit, **The Book of Demons** isn't a great book but isn't a terrible book either. It starts out with a description of how the villain of the story came by his powers and then moved into the story proper. I found the story boring at times and exciting at others.

To be honest, I was hoping for a much bigger ending than what happened. I actually called the ending in my head as soon as the actual ending started. To be honest, the book isn't scary or even unsettling, it's just... there.

I gave the book 3.5 stars because as I said, it's not great but it's not terrible either. This one would be good for those who aren't regular horror readers but who want to try their hand at reading horror without the full-on terrifying aspect you might find from Dean Koontz, Stephen King, or John Saul.
