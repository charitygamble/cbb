The first thing you need to know about **The Princess and the Grilled Cheese Sandwich**? That it's absolutely adorable. Well, the story is. The artwork is beautiful, but the story is just adorable.

I love Cam - she's strong, independent, but is also lonely and bored due to the lifestyle she's forced to lead. So when opportunity presents itself, she does what she can to make her life less miserable and falls in love in the process.

I'm also quite partial to Brie... she's sweet, kind, loving, and funny. I love that she's an activist because she hates injustice...

And might I say, I'm overly amused at Lady Ricotta and her inability to mind her own business.

The setting is awesome - lots of references to cheese, some of which are super amusing but I'll let you read it yourself to see what I'm talking about. The hints of misogyny are there and they will annoy you, and probably make you wonder why they even exist, but it's a good part of the plot and you'll understand later in the story why they figure so much into the story.

The ending is wonderful and I think you'll find it as adorable as I did. I gave this book four stars because it's just a really fun, fast-paced, adorable romance in graphic novel form.
