Ok, so when I go into reading an "indie" horror novel, I usually go in expecting to intensely dislike it because, honestly, that's usually how it goes for me. I end up hating it because it's either horribly written, makes no sense, or is just not fear-inducing whatsoever. I was pleasantly surprised by **The Dunnie**.

Now, I'm not going to pretend that this book was super fear-inducing, because for me it wasn't. But I'll be honest, I don't scare easily when it comes to horror novels or movies. But this book _was_ very creepy.

It took me a bit to get into it, but once I got going, I flew through the book. Granted, it's only about 150 pages long... but still. Once I got into it, I just didn't want to put it down. In fact, I don't think I did except for when I absolutely had to (aka, I had to tend to certain physical and medical needs).

I loved the concept - having a creature born of the qualities that a person wants to rid themselves of, then later on them having to fight that creature off and destroy it as best they can to ensure the safety of their loved ones. It made for a very interesting story line and one that honestly, I'd read again... which is good because **The Dunnie** isn't the only book Keith Thomas has written in this particular vein.

The book is extremely well written.... which I'd hope so since Keith Thomas is a screenwriter and director who wrote/directed THE VIGIL and directed the ["Pickman's Model"](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81041071) episode of Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities (on Netflix, at least in the US).

I give this a solid 4 stars because it's a great, short horror novel. I'll definitely be looking into reading some of the others that follow it!
