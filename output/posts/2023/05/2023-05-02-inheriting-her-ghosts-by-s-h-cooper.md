## The Review

If there's one thing we know about me, it is that I love horror novels. While I don't review a ton of them here on Charli's Book Box, I love to read them. So of course, I was thrilled to be selected to review **Inheriting Her Ghosts** by S.H. Cooper. I'll be honest, I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this one but I'll say this, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I'll start this off by saying if you're not a fan of slow-burn horror novels, this one may not be for you. But I'd still recommend giving it a chance because you never know.

**Inheriting Her Ghosts** focuses on Eudora Fellowes and her struggle with her newly inherited property - and the ghosts she apparently inherited along with it. I love that Eudora doesn't conform to who and what society says she should be. She doesn't generally care what people say about her or think about her. I admire that greatly. I also love her wolfhounds, Cerberus and Black Shuck. First, she named one after the three headed dog who guards the Underworld and second, she named the other after a ghostly dog of legend - what's not to love?

The hauntings start off slow and get more intense as the book goes on. While it doesn't take Eudora long to realize that yes, indeed, her new home is haunted, she does exhibit the usual skepticism about it. While the initial hauntings won't leave you feeling like this is a horror novel, trust me, the later hauntings, especially toward the end of the book, absolutely will.

While some may not go for the traditional\[mfn\]Some might say campy\[/mfn\] horror elements, they're definitely present in this book, especially since this book is about being haunted. The ending to this book is not to be missed as it comes with a few surprises to say the least.

I gave **Inheriting Her Ghosts** 4 stars because it was a darned good book. I read it in about a day, with most of that being read in couple of hours. I look forward to reading more from S.H. Cooper.
