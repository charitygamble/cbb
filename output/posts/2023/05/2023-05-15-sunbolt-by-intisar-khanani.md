Today I'm bringing you a review of a short, but very cool middle young adult fantasy - **Sunbolt** by Intisar Khanani. **Sunbolt** is the first book in **The Sunbolt Chronicles** and it came in 3rd in the 2022 BBNYA. Congrats!

I loved that **Sunbolt** is a short read. So many of the fantasy novels I read are 300-500 pages long and just seem to take so long for me to read that I end up not wanting to read them. So the fact that this one is only 152 pages is a huge plus in my opinion.

I also loved the writing in **Sunbolt**. It wasn't overly flowery, it wasn't overly long on the narration. It gave you the information you needed, when you needed it. You won't have to wade through two pages of unnecessary descriptions to read this book. It's simple, easy to follow, and just plain awesome.

Now, I loved our main character, Hitomi. Of course, I love the whole trope of having magic but having to keep it a secret for whatever reason. But I just found her to be a great character all around. She's had losses but she doesn't play the victim. She still wants to help others. She still has a conscience. A lot of characters who've had losses or bad things happen to them end up cynical and hardened, but not Hitomi. She still has heart.

I also loved Val. There's just something about him - and when you come to a certain part of the book, there's something he says that I don't think means what it sounds like. You'll know what I mean when you come to it. He's not like the other "breathers"...

There are other characters of course, but the two you see most in **Sunbolt** are Hitomi and Val, so they're the ones I decided to talk about.

As for the plot? It was interesting and it moved along quite well. There are things that aren't resolved, but since this is a series (or at very least, a duology), that's to be expected. I gave this book a solid 4 stars because it was just a great fantasy book all around.
