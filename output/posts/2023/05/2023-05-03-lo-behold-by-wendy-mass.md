When I decided to review this book, it was quite out of character for me. For one, I'm not a big fan of reading Middle Grade fiction. For another, I'm not a big lover of graphic novels. But when I read the description of **Lo & Behold**, I couldn't help but feel like I should give it a try. I'm glad I did.

This graphic novel made me think. You never know what someone else is going through or what they've been through. Whether it is having to move across the country for a few months, losing friends, or losing a loved one, you just don't know what might be behind the things another person says or does. **Lo & Behold** does a beautiful job of showcasing that.

One thing I thought was interesting was the actual placement in the book of Addie's story about what happened with her mom. I'd have thought it would have come right in the beginning as an explanation of why it was that Addie and her dad were alone. But it doesn't come at the beginning, it comes later. When it does come, it's easy to understand why it wasn't put at the beginning.

I also loved the use of tech in this graphic novel. Things I'd never have thought VR could do... and honestly, it's pretty amazing (even if it isn't real - or is it?). I loved the way the kids decided to use what they knew and what they were learning to help other kids.

I think this is a great book for middle grade kids and even older kids/adults to read. They can learn about grief, having empathy for others, and helping others. I gave this book 4.5 stars and highly recommend it.
