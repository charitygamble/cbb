Ok, we've established that I'm not the biggest fan of middle grade books, although I have read quite a few and the ones I've read have been very good. But I'm a huge fan of James Patterson, so my reading **Minerva Keen's Detective Club** seemed like a no-brainer... with the exception of the fact that I'm not a big fan of James Patterson having co-authors. For some reason, the only books I've been able to read that he's had a co-author for were **The President is Missing** and **The President's Daughter**, which he co-wrote with Bill Clinton. Other co-written books have just fell flat for me. But this one? Oh, this one definitely was to my liking.

For one, it was funny. From the hilarious reaction Minerva has to being nervous to a scheme Heck\[mfn\]Minerva's younger brother\[/mfn\] comes up with, I kept finding myself laughing out loud at this book. My roommates thought I'd lost my mind because I don't often laugh while reading books\[mfn\]In my defense, I read a lot of fantasy, horror, and thrillers that don't usually have much humor in them\[/mfn\].

For another, the book was seamless. One of my biggest pet peeves with James Patterson's co-written books is that I can usually tell the difference between the authors and it drives me bananas. But with Keir Graff and James Patterson writing together, I couldn't tell who had written any particular chapter or part of the book. While it seemed at one point there might have been a continuity error, it's also possible that I just wasn't paying attention.

**Minerva Keen's Detective Club** is a very well written, fast-paced book. I read the entire book in a total of about 3 hours. I didn't want to put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next. After all, there are several things going on in this book - and an ending you won't expect. I know I certainly didn't. I think this a great book to get your middle-grade aged kiddo into James Patterson and into reading.

I gave the book 5 stars because it truly is an amazing middle grade novel that deserves every one of the stars I gave it. I highly recommend this book - even if you aren't a middle grade reader, if you like James Patterson, I think you'll like this.
