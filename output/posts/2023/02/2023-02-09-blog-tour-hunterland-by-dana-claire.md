Today we have a special treat - an interview with Dana Claire, author of _Hunterland_! I asked some "non-traditional" questions to be a bit unique, and I love her answers! Here's my interview with Dana Claire...

**Do you plan to read reviews of "Hunterland" and if you do, how will you respond to negative  
reviews?**  
  
I love reading reviews. I think it’s a great way to connect to your readers. Good or bad, I genuinely  
am just grateful for a person wanting to pick up my work and curl up with it to read. Writing is  
subjective so negative reviews never bother me. Most of the time, I learn from them just like anyone  
would learn from feedback. The readers who review my work have always been so kind to me that  
all I can say is thank you to them all.

**What was your favorite book as a child and do you think it influenced "Hunterland"?**  
  
My favorite book as a child was 101 Dalmatians. I asked my father every night to read it to me, so  
much so I had it memorized and could tell if he skipped any words. To this day, my dad still gets  
flustered talking about it. He’d be so tired from working a twelve hour day and then his little girl  
would beg for a story and how could he refuse. I’m not sure the Disney book influenced my writing  
Hunterland. However, I have been told I do write similarly to how Disney portrays parents, deceased  
and/or murdered in the book/movie. I think being raised on Disney did influence my writing in that  
sense.

**What did you listen to (if anything) while writing "Hunterland"?**   
  
I like to have minimal to no background noise while I write. A trick I learned from a fellow author is  
to read your work out loud. It’ll help you catch grammatical mistakes you might not find if you read  
to yourself. Music or any other distractions delay my writing and editing.

**Did you encounter any writer's block with "Hunterland" and if so, how did you get yourself  
going again?**  
  
Hunterland was a magical unicorn for me. I saw the book in my head and the words just flowed from  
there to my fingertips. It is not always like that, though. I’d probably say that when I do experience  
writers block, I have two methods of solving it. One, I pick up a book from a writer with good habits.  
Any book that I am interested in and get lost in another story line. Or two, I watch a movie. Typically  
I try and watch a moving in the genre I am writing. That seems to get my creative juices flowing and  
my brain back on track. I am lucky. I haven’t had much of writer’s block since I started my author  
journey in 2020. Even currently, I have three books I’m in the middle of constructing and my fingers  
just won’t type fast enough to catch up to my brain.

**Have you made any literary pilgrimages? (Visiting a favorite author's home town, doing in- 
person research for the setting of a novel, visiting the setting of a favorite novel, etc.)**  
  
I haven’t but a little sneak peak into the future. If the Hunterland series goes to book four or five, I’ll  
be making a trip to London to research where Hunterland all began since the secret society started  
there centuries ago.

**(Optional fun question) - Name three authors whose books you love and/or three authors you  
just can't get into.**  
  
C. W. Farnsworth – She writes NA/Adult contemporary romance. The irony in loving her so much is  
that I don’t write that genre. I like YA and have stayed in that lane and will continue to do so for the  
near future. But something about C.W Farnsworth’s writing captivates me. Her books are fun romances that I can read in one sitting and think about long after the book is finished. She’s a one- 
click author for me.  
  
Adrienne Young – I was hooked from Fable’s first page and ran through all of Adrienne’s books  
within a month’s time. We do write the same genre and I always love seeing how her creativity flows  
with in her work. Although we have very different writing styles, she’s my go-to in my own  
categories to read when I’m in a reading slump.  
  
My third spot is a tie between Jennifer Armentrout and Tricia Levenseller. Both women are excellent  
at their craft. I think I’ve read everything they have written or at least 90% of their work. Jennifer  
was so sweet. When my novel, The Reclaimed Kingdom, first released she posted it on her IG page.  
I’ve never been so honored before in my life by another writer who didn’t know me from Adam but  
was supporting me anyway. That’s a true testament to character and I’ll never forget her for it.  
Maybe I should move her to number one.
