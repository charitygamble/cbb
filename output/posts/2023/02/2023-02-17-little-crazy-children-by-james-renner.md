Ok, so whether you want to believe it or not, I actually do like true crime books. I don't read a lot of them, but I'm picky about them . Honestly, I'm not even sure what made me decide to request to read **Little Crazy Children** by James Renner. Now for this book, the usual CAWPILE review isn't going to cut it, so this time around you're just going to get my thoughts.

## About Little Crazy Children

**Little Crazy Children** takes on the 1990 murder case of 16-year-old Lisa Lee Pruett. The book details how the Shaker Heights police honed in on one suspect despite there being other suspects.

## My Thoughts

First off, this book is very well written. It makes sense, and the investigative work done to ensure that the facts are presented was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the final few chapters in which Mr. Renner chose to give us insight as to how he came to write the book as well as his insights into who the real killer might have been.

**Little Crazy Children** really showcases the court of public opinion and how people's lives can be ruined by false accusations. People don't want to hear the truth once they've made up their minds, unless that truth coincides with their opinion on the matter. It also does an excellent job of showcasing the way in which law enforcement officials can influence the court of public opinion when they want to.

The case of Lisa Lee Pruett's death has never been solved. This is mostly because no one wants to believe that Kevin Young isn't guilty. Is it possible Kevin Young is guilty? Sure, anything is possible. But to be honest, I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Renner on this one - it isn't him. As you read **Little Crazy Children**, you'll find that there are plenty of other people who are more likely to have done it. But I'll leave you to find out who those people are on your own.

This is a great true crime book and I encourage people to read it - especially if you live in Shaker Heights and have never heard of this case. It's a very interesting read.
