Our review for today is for H. C. Newell's **The Forbidden Realms**. This is book 2 in the **Fallen Light** series. The front matter of the book actually says this book is to be read _after_ book 1, **Curse of the Fallen**.

\[book-info\]

Ok, first, you'll need to read the trigger warnings for this book. If you have issues with grief, gore, horror, etc., then I can tell you now, this book will not be for you... if **Curse of the Fallen** wasn't for you, this one won't be either.

A quick note about **Curse of the Fallen** - it took me two tries to actually read it. Not because it wasn't a good book, it was a "right book, wrong time" situation, which I knew from the beginning when I was having trouble with it. The book was good, my brain just didn't want to focus on it. I read **Curse of the Fallen** and **The Forbidden Realms** in the span of a week, so yes, they are that good because I usually don't read fantasy novels of any sort back-to-back. Now...

After finishing **Curse of the Fallen**, I jumped straight into **The Forbidden Realms**. As in, I put **Curse of the Fallen** down and picked up **The Forbidden Realms** and started reading. We're still following Nerana, Neer to those of us in the know, but we've got some new characters joining us for this journey. What can I say - I loved the characters I was supposed to love, hated the characters I was supposed to hate (don't get me started on The Nasir). I was a bit confused as to who AÃ©lla was at first, but then figured it out later.

I quite enjoyed our change of scenery for this book - so many series end up with every book being set in the same place and it can get boring or get old. Not so with the **Fallen Light** series so far. I love this because for one, it gives us a chance to see different parts of the world in which our beloved characters live. For another, it makes it so we don't get bored with the scenery.

I really liked the plot to this one as well. Ok, we all know that the basics of a fantasy novel plot involve one or more people going on a quest to do or find something. But it's how that basic plot is executed that makes the difference. Trust me when I say, this book follows the basic fantasy novel plot, but does so in a spectacular way.

I want to say one more thing about a particular character - Thorne gives me Winter Soldier vibes and I kept picturing Sebastian Stan ala Captain America and the Winter Soldier... metal arm, mask, etc... Just saying.

This book was a ride from the beginning to the end. I loved it so much and I can't wait for the third book in the series. This was a solid four star read and I can't recommend this series enough.
