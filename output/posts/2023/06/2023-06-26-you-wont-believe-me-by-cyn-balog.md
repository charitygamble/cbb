**You Won't Believe Me** by Cyn Balog was a ride from beginning to end. A fast paced Young Adult novel that is part thriller, part horror, and all awesome.

You really only get to know two characters, Willow and Elijah. You get to know them, sort of. By the end of the book you won't know what about them is real or isn't. But that's the beauty of the story. You just don't know because you won't know what to believe. Just as you think you know who these two are and what they are, a twist pops up and you're back to square one with them. Brilliant.

This is one of the most unique plots I've seen in a long time. You start out thinking something is horribly wrong but don't know exactly what, then find out there was some sort of zombie apocalypse, but then a twist blows everything you'd discovered out of the water. It's a brilliant plot and I was entranced by it for the entirety of the book.

The writing was simply awesome. It was easy to read, easy to follow, and it didn't drag. Sure, some might find some of the descriptive areas to be boring or unnecessary, but the fact of the matter is, the descriptive areas serve a purpose that will be revealed when it is time. I read the book in a matter of hours - I think around 4 hours, maybe 5 - because I couldn't put it down.

The ending is absolutely amazing. You'll never see the ending coming. I was so startled when I finished this book because I just never thought that what Elijah says is true... trust me when I say, the title is apt.

I gave this book 4.5 stars because it's a beautifully written story that gives off dystopian and zombie apocalypse vibes with a huge twist at the end that knocks you out of your chair.
