Let me be clear - I love horror novels. In fact, I don't often find horror novels that I'm not a big fan of. That being said... I wasn't a big fan of this one.

For one thing, I felt absolutely no connection to any of the characters. I didn't have the "Oh I hope that one doesn't die" or "I hope that one isn't one of the bad guys" feeling about any of them. They were there and that was that. I will give the author credit for at least giving some background for the main characters, but other than that, I just didn't feel connected to any of them.

The writing wasn't the best. I realize this was an "uncorrected proof" but the amount of mistakes - extra words, missing words, missing or incorrect punctuation, sentences that should have been one sentence instead of two or three - makes me think that an editor didn't even see the book before it was put on NetGalley. That being said, I was able to make sense of the book.

The pacing was just horrible - I felt like I was just slogging through the book the entire time I was reading it. It was such a struggle for me to keep going, but I didn't want to DNF the book for some reason. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just didn't.

There were no appreciable plot twists and the few there were I had been easily able to predict. The ending wasn't spectacular either. I can't say that I'd read anything else by this author. Two stars because the story was somewhat readable, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to read anything by her again.
