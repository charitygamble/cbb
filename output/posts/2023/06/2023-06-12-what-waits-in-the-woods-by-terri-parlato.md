If you haven't seen the review I did for Terri Parlato's debut novel, [**All The Dark Places**](https://www.charlisbookbox.com/book-review-all-the-dark-places-by-terri-parlato/), I highly recommend you check it out - go ahead, I'll wait... Ok, now that you're back, I'm going to tell you that this book is just as good. You've heard of the sophomore slump? That weird thing where the second book isn't as good as the first or any subsequent books that come out? Well, this book doesn't have that.

What this book does have is a dual point of view that doesn't take much to get used to because it's very clear as to who is telling the story at any given moment.

The main characters we deal with are Esmé and Rita. Esmé is our main character, the one who just came back from Syracuse after her ballet career ended. She came home only to find her best friend, Kara, had been murdered and was found on Esmé's family's property. Then we have Rita, the detective in charge of Kara's murder case. Add in Esmé's brother Byron and father Tom, Tom's friend Irene, neighbors Ray Ridley Jr, Cynthia Ridley, and Alan York, plus Esmé's friends Laney, Christy, and Jack and we've got an interesting cast of characters. To be honest, there weren't any characters I fully disliked - with the exception of Alan York who was a bit on the creepy side. I wasn't overly fond of him, but the rest were fine.

I loved the writing and the plot. The twists were awesome - with new information coming in at varying points. But the big twist was one you just wouldn't see coming - because there wasn't any reason to. I kept thinking it would be one character who murdered Kara, but then something would be revealed that would make me think another character was the murderer. And who it turns out to be isn't someone I'd ever even considered.

This was a great second novel from Terri Parlato and I can't wait to read more of her work. She's already become a "must buy" author for me. This book gets a solid four stars. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good mystery/thriller/psychological thriller.
