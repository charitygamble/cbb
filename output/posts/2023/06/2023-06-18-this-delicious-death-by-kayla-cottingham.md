CW: Gore, blood, graphic depictions of violence

I have to say, this is probably the best take I’ve seen on a zombie apocalypse ever. It’s not your typical take on it because for one, the “zombies” aren’t zombies, they’re ghouls. For another, they’re not mindless creatures incapable of doing anything but shambling along and eating flesh. What makes them even more unique? They can only eat human flesh - animal flesh or plant-based foods make them sick. I love it.

While I’m not overly fond of Jasmine or Valeria, I love Zoey and Celeste. I love that most, if not all, of the friend group are part of the LGBTQIA+ community. The characters are well defined and we get back stories for each of them from the Hollowing, which gives insight into their experiences. Oh and I want slap the crap out Zoey’s parents, just saying.

The writing is well done and is easy to read, with the pacing of the book moving along at a great speed. It took me less than 24 hours to finish the book. There are interesting plot twists that you don’t see coming but that make the story even better.

I gave this book 5 stars because Kayla Cottingham does an amazing job of taking the tired zombie trend and bringing it back to new life.
