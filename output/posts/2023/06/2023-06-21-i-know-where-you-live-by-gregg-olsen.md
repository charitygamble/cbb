Have you ever read a book, really loved it, and just really disliked pretty much all of the characters in the book? That's how I felt about **I Know Where You Live** by Gregg Olsen. I loved the book, loved the premise of the book, but really didn't like the characters.

Violet and Lily were just irksome to me. Violet's holier-than-thou attitude and Lily just basically doing her best to ignore everything that was going on just annoyed the daylights out of me.

I understood Rose and her mother's dynamic because I lived through that time when you didn't speak of things like sexual assault/molestation - even though we got the talks about "if someone touches you inappropriately, tell someone", no one really did... it just wasn't something you did. So I totally understand Rose and her mother's dynamic in that respect.

So if I didn't like the characters, what kept me reading the book? The plot. The things that were going on with Violet, the things she was doing. The things that were alluded to in regards to her grandfather's death. The possible plot twists, which came and did not disappoint. That's what kept me reading this book.

I'm not going to say much else about it. The plot alone was worth 4 stars. If I'd liked the characters, I might have given it 5 stars.

Oh... and I made a playlist of some songs you might want to listen to while reading... You'll understand some of the choices when you read the book.
