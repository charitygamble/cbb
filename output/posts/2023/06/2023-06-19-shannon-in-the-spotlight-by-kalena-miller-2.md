CW: Mental Illness, OCD, Anxiety

I’m going to say it - I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. I’m not usually a fan of middle grade books, but I did enjoy this one.

I like the way it portrays mental illnesses as nothing to be ashamed of. That someone with mental illness, whether it be OCD, anxiety, depression, or other mental illnesses can do the things they want and the things that make them happy. So often I read about mental illness in books and the person is defined by it. While Shannon’s OCD and anxiety feature in the book, they’re not who she is.

I loved Shannon. I also loved Micah and Grandma Ruby. I admit, there weren’t any characters in this book I didn’t like, which is a rarity.

The writing was great, the book moves along at a good pace, and the plot is interesting. I love how even in a contemporary middle grade novel, you can have a twist - even if that twist is more of a solution to a problem.

I gave this book 4 stars because it was a cute, fun read that I recommend to anyone who likes middle grade novels or has kids in middle grade age.
