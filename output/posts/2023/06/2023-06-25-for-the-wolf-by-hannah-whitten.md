I was approved for **For the Wolf** on NetGalley before the book even came out. But however many times I tried to read it, I just couldn't do it. So I told NetGalley I couldn't finish it and wouldn't be giving feedback. Then I bought it on Kindle, along with **For the Throne**, thinking maybe if I had the whole duology, I'd read it. It took me a year to actually read **For the Wolf**, but when I did, I read it in 2 or 3 days. Holy cow, I don't know why it took me so long to actually get into this book and read it.

I love Red, Neve, Arick, Raffe, Lyra, Fife, and Eammon. I absolutely can't stand Kiri. I seriously wanted to throttle her the entire book. As for Neve and Arick, they were misguided in their actions but they did what they thought was right. I loved that Eammon was nothing like what he was supposed to be. The fact that Red just wanted to protect her sister from her "dangerous" magic made me sad.

The writing is beautiful in this book. I can't wait to read more of Hannah Whitten's writing. In fact, I started **For the Throne** immediately after finishing **For the Wolf** because I wanted to keep going with the story.

I loved this plot. It seemed almost like a mixture of **Rumpelstiltskin** and **Beauty & the Beast**. You have to read the book to understand how these two things come in to play and some might say that **Rumpelstiltskin** isn't there, but I assure you, elements of it is.

The ending was interesting and left the opening to **For the Throne** in a perfect manner. I enjoyed the ending thoroughly and can't wait to see what happens in **For the Throne**.

I gave this 4.5 stars because it's an amazing book and I highly recommend it for those looking for adult fantasy (as per Hannah Whitten herself, her books are not YA).
