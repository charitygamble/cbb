Now you all know I love a good mystery/thriller novel and it doesn't matter if it's YA or Adult fiction. This one happens to be YA and it's amazing! So let's break down why I gave this book five stars, shall we?

First, we have our characters. I love Emma and Travis. Not so fond of Simon and Kristin... but that's kind of to be expected. I mean, after all, the more you read, the more you realize their relationship is just... weird. But... Emma and Travis? LOVE these two. They're just great characters all around. You know what motivates them, even if you haven't read the first book, **None Shall Sleep**.

The plot for this book is quite interesting... the survivor of a serial killer helping the FBI to find a serial killer who is mimicking the very serial killer she escaped from. Deal with side plots such as the chemistry between Travis and Emma and the weirdness of Simon's and Kristin's relationship with each other. It's a wild ride but it's a great plot.

One of the things I like best about this book is that while you can tell it's the second book in the series, you don't absolutely need to read the first book to be able to follow what's happening in this one. You can glean what you need to know to move forward with the story. Will you want to read the first book after this? Probably... I know I certainly do!

I also love the setting - we're in 1982. There were a few things mentioned I had to make sure existed in 1982 because I didn't remember them being around then! (Yes I'm old.) But it's so much fun to see YA novels that go back in time to other eras - especially ones that today's youth know practically nothing about.

All in all, this was a great read and one that was very difficult to put down. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of Ellie Marney's works. This one got 5 stars from me.
