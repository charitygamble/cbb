Today is my stop on the Escapist Book Co blog tour for Matthew Samuels's **Wild Court**. This is an urban fantasy that deals with the paranormal. Thank you to Escapist Book Co and Matthew Samuels for allowing me to participate in this blog tour.

When I first read the description for **Wild Court**, I was intrigued. I'm not usually one for urban fantasy novels, but I wanted to give it a try. I'm so glad I did.

**Wild Court** has a unique spin on urban fantasy. It's paranormal fantasy and it is done in a way that I haven't really seen before. There is a slow build up to the full issue, but once the full issue is at hand, the book moves pretty quickly. Honestly, the slow build up is rather nice - it keeps the book from feeling rushed.

I liked the characters - most of them at least, although I must say I wasn't overly fond of Alice. It wasn't that she was a bad character and she certainly wasn't evil, she just had that obnoxious know-it-all air about her that annoyed me. Other than that, I was quite satisfied with the characters. I knew who to root for, who I should absolutely despise, and who was in neutral territory. All in all, great characters.

The writing style is easy to read. There are some things it took me a bit to figure out - since I'm in the US, I didn't know that people in the UK call McDonald's "Macca's" and I was thrown off until I looked it up on Google. But other than a few terms that weren't familiar as they are UK lingo, I was able to read through the book quite quickly. There aren't any grammar or editing errors that I noticed.

The ending might seem anticlimactic or even rushed to some, but I don't think it was. I feel like the ending moved at exactly the pace it was supposed to. There was a part of the ending that made me think "seriously dude?" but that was due to something a character did not anything bad about the ending. I gave this book a solid four stars as it is a great, fun read.
