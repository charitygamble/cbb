Today I’m pleased to bring you an interview with Herman Steurenagel, author of Eclipse. This interview is part of my stop on the blog tour organized by Escapist Book Co. Thank you for allowing me to participate, and thank you to Herman Steurenagel for answering my questions.

### Do you read reviews of your books? If so, how do you handle bad or good reviews?

Even though they say you’re not supposed to, I do read my reviews. Good reviews are always exciting to receive, and it’s great to know that someone else is enjoying my work. Negative reviews are only one person’s opinion of the story, and I appreciate that my books are not going to be to everyone’s taste.

### What is the best way you’ve found to market your books?

A little bit of everything adds up. Honestly the best thing has been reaching out to book reviewers and influencers to get the word out. My audience only reaches so far, but if I’m able to utilize a wider reach from people who I know like similar books to mine, that has gone a long way.

### Have you gone on any literary pilgrimages? If so, where have you gone?

For my own series, The Terre Hoffman Chronicles. Books 2 & 3 of that series, Artificial Insurgence and Artificial Insurrection take place, in part, at the Hoover Dam and in the Nevada desert. I had done a lot of research online while writing the series, but two years ago while I was writing the books I had the chance to rent a car from Las Vegas and head out to see it for myself. It was kind of cool to see the setting in my own work come to life.

### What is your favorite thing to listen to while you write?

While I’m writing I like to put on familiar music that will pump me up without distracting me. This usually comes in the form of 90s alternative rock. During the editing phase, though, I need something without any words. There’s a Spotify playlist called Lo-Fi Beats that gets heavy rotation during this time.

### Do you think it helps authors to have a big ego or hurts them?

I don’t think having a big ego is a benefit to anyone. You’re only as good as your last book, and an author owes any success they have to their readership. There are a lot of amazingly talented authors who nobody has ever heard of.

### Do you ever have reader’s block or reading slumps? How do you get yourself out of  
them?

I am typically a slow reader to begin with, so if I am not resonating with a book I don’t hesitate to DNF. Sometimes that means I’ll come back to it when I’m more in the mood for it. I don’t know if I have reading slumps as much as I will go through periods where it’s hard for me to make time to read, especially when writing deadlines are looming. Currently I’m in different stages of editing for two books, in addition to marketing them, a full-time job and I’ve just started a podcast. So taking the time to read, even books I want to, is a challenge. This year I’ve discovered audiobooks, which does help, as I can listen during times where I would otherwise struggle to read, like on my way to work.

### Do you read the genre of books you write? Do you read your own books after they’re  
finished?

I almost exclusively read science fiction and fantasy books, but the breadth of books that I read within those two genres is quite wide. As long as it has an element of the fantastical I’m willing to consider it. By the time my book comes out I’ve already read them fifty billion times (give or take), so I don’t tend to want to go through them again. However, as I get deeper into my series, I am going to need to revisit each of my books to ensure elements of the world and plot remain consistent.
