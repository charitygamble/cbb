## Interview

**Do you plan to read reviews of "Not Here to Stay Friends" and if you do, how will you  
respond to negative reviews?**

I generally don’t seek out reviews! They’re a space meant for readers, and I respect reviewers’ right to share opinions freely while also protecting myself from having to take in a whole spectrum of opinions on work that’s already out in the world.

**What was your favorite book as a child and do you think it influenced "Not Here to Stay  
Friends"?**

Growing up, I was obsessed with Ally Carter’s Gallagher Girls series, about an all girls spy school. While I’ve yet to write anything as cool as spies, I think the element of an ensemble cast of girls who lift each other up–even in an environment as intense and traditionally set up for conflict as a reality show set–definitely comes through in NHTSF! Carter also writes the swooniest male leads/love interests, which probably plays a role in how I develop male characters like Liam. ☺️

**What did you listen to (if anything) while writing "Not Here to Stay Friends"?**

I’m the type to listen to one or two albums on repeat until I’m sick of them, and the early stages of this book definitely came together in my folklore/evermore phase! I love the way Taylor Swift tells stories in those albums, and the general vibe is chill enough that I could listen to it while writing without getting too distracted.

**Did you encounter any writer's block with "Not Here to Stay Friends" and if so, how did you get yourself going again?**

I usually hit a wall at some point (or multiple points) in everything I write, but I’ve found the important thing for me is not to lose momentum. I can and do take breaks and recharge from time to time, but if I feel myself extending the break beyond what I need just out of laziness, I make myself go back to the project and write whatever I can on it, even if it isn’t great. The longer I go without writing, the harder it is to get back into it!

**Have you made any literary pilgrimages? (Visiting a favorite author's home town, doing in-person research for the setting of a novel, visiting the setting of a favorite novel, etc.)**

I need to do more! I haven’t really done any intentionally, but when I lived in Seattle, I went to Olympic National Park and passed through Forks, Washington, of Twilight fame! It’s an incredibly beautiful area, even if you’re not into the Twilight things. In the future, I’d love to go to some author-owned bookstores, like Nora Roberts’s or Judy Blume’s.

**Name three authors whose books you love and/or three authors you just can't get into.**

I could give a long list of authors I love, but I think every YA romance lover should be reading Elise Bryant, Samantha Markum, and Rachel Lynn Solomon!
