Our review for today is for **They Lie Here** by NS Ford. This post is one of the stops on the blog tour for this book. Thank you to TheWriteReads/BBNYA for allowing me to be a part of this tour.

**They Lie Here** is an interesting mystery/thriller that also has some elements of science fiction... all centered around a woman trying to find out what happened to a musician from the 1980s who has disappeared.

Kat Green is a former teen pop star who is trying to escape her past while also trying to "help" other former celebrities come out of hiding by finding them. I have to say, she isn't a particularly likeable gal - after all, her main business is being a nosy woman who won't leave celebrities who aren't in the spotlight anymore alone. Her target in **They Lie Here**? Roskoe Darke, formerly of Scorpio Hearts.

I found the book to be well written and very interesting. It was paced great without a lot of extraneous fluff. It did take a bit to connect some of the chapters back to Kat but that could have been me just being sleep-deprived. I had trouble putting it down and managed to read 3/4 of it in one sitting. I read the final 1/4 of the book in a second sitting. The book goes fairly quickly despite being nearly 300 pages.

I found the science fiction elements of the story to be intriguing. I've seen similar things before of course, but the way it was being executed here was quite interesting. I also found the ending of the book to be rather interesting and amusing.

I gave this one four stars and recommend it to anyone who likes books that center around former rock stars that are now missing, science fiction involving possible immortality, or weird characters with pasts they'd like to forget.
