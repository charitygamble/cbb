## Last Sunrise in Eterna - The Review

### Characters

There are so many characters in **Last Sunrise in Eterna** that have a lot to do with the story, so I really don't want to go into too much detail regarding specific characters. I will say that I really enjoyed Sevim - she and I are a lot alike (aside from the fact that I am not Puerto Rican - I mean music and fashion tastes and loving to read). I also greatly enjoyed Aro - although sometimes I didn't and you'll understand more about that when you read the book. As far as Aro's brother, Feyn is concerned, I don't care much for him, but later on I came to understand why he is the way he is. I also loved Jason and Ryujin.

### Atmosphere

I appreciated the fact that in **Last Sunrise in Eterna** we have elves (Aro, Feyn, and others) interacting with humans on EARTH... not some made up planet. But actually on Earth, in Puerto Rico. It's pretty cool and I really loved it. It gave the book the basic elements of fantasy while actually having it be a normal setting. Loved it.

### Writing

The writing style in **Last Sunrise in Eterna** is absolutely wonderful. It is easy to read, easy to follow, and even when something is said in Spanish, it isn't that hard to figure out what's going on or what's being said. The book had wonderful pacing and I loved that I was never bored with the book. It did take me a bit to get into, but that was more of "right book, wrong time" than anything wrong with the book.

### Plot

Do we have books where people are chosen to go do this or that? Yes, of course we do. But what about books where those people are heading off to an island full of elves? On Earth no less? With twists and turns you will never see coming... you have to read this book to believe how amazing this plot is. Seriously, **Last Sunrise in Eterna** is not a book you should be sleeping on!

### Intrigue

Trust me, this is a fantasy book, YA fantasy to be exact, and it has plenty of intrigue. Unless you're not a fan of fantasy or elves, you will love this book. There are elves, magic, danger, mystery, and the best plot twists you'll ever see. Intrigue is definitely a part of this book.

### Romance

Oh come on, what's a good YA Fantasy without a little romance? I'm not going to tell you who the romance is between, but in all honesty, I think there might be more than one brewing in this book. However, with this book appearing to be a standalone, we may never see them come to fruition. But the romance is cute and it is a slow-burn for the romance, because there are issues. But what romance doesn't have issues?

### Ending

The ending to this book will blow you away. There are plot twists that come towards the end that just smack you out of left-field. While the absolute ending somewhat leaves things open for a possible sequel, the book is finished well enough the way it ends.

## Conclusion

I gave this book 4 stars because it is an amazing read - I wouldn't call it one of my favorites for this year, although since we're only in April, it's possible it could still become one! I'm telling you, this is a book you need to read!
