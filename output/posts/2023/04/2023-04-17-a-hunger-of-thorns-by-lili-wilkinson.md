Do you ever pick up a book thinking it's going to be amazing and then realize part way through that the book is good, but not as amazing as you'd thought it would be? That's kind of what I got with **A Hunger of Thorns**. Let me explain...

When I first started looking at **A Hunger of Thorns**, I was pulled in by the description and by the cover. The cover is absolutely gorgeous. I also love the title. But when I started reading the book it just wasn't quite the book I thought it was going to be.

For one, I don't like Odette - at all. She just makes me think of an absolutely spoiled brat who has to have her way no matter what. She wants magic and she's going to get it no matter what. Just not my type of character.

Maude... well, my relationship with her as a character is complicated. I like her, but I also don't like her. She mentions the loss of her magic quite often. I get that she's a witch without magic, but I sometimes felt like she mentioned it too often.

I like the world in this book and would like to see more of the world itself. Perhaps with different characters. Although, after reading the ending, I would like to see these characters all grown up. After all, they are teenagers in the book.

The story and plot are great. I just had trouble reading the book and staying with it. I'm wondering if it is a matter of right book, wrong time, because normally if I'm having trouble staying with a book, it is because I don't like the content of the book. But that wasn't the case here.

I gave the book 3.5 stars because like I said, the book is good, it just wasn't my cup of tea - at least right now. Perhaps later I will revisit the book and it will be more to my liking.
