Today's book review for **We the Future** by Cliff Lewis is brought to you as part of the [TBR & Beyond Tours blog tour](https://tbrandbeyondtours.com/2023/03/11/tour-schedule-we-the-future-by-cliff-lewis/). Read on to see what I have to say about this thought provoking book.

\[book-info\]

I can't truly quantify my thoughts about this particular book using the usual "CAWPILE/CAWPIRE" method, so I'm not going to even try.

**We the Future** paints a fictional picture of a bleak future due to a very real and very serious issue - climate change. It also paints a picture of how the youth of today can rally themselves together to help instigate changes to mitigate the damage being done to our environment and our climate.

One thing I appreciate is that Cliff Lewis manages to do the above without being preachy. If there's one thing that will turn me off from a book about being eco-friendly, environmental issues, climate change, etc., it is when the book comes across as thought the author were a preacher standing at the pulpit to preach a sermon. Mr. Lewis managed to keep the preachy tone out of the book and make the subject interesting.

Am I saying that the events in the book are necessarily the way it would work in real life (minus the time-traveler)? No, I'm not. I'm also not saying that our youth should take cues from the methods used in the book - unless of course their parents are cool with it. But... I do think that this book brings a lot of useful things to light.

For instance, talking about climate change as a real thing. Talking about greenwashing and how all the little changes we make just distract us from the bigger picture. And showing kids that they _can_ be activists, even at their young age. The idea that you don't have to wait until you're an adult to take a stand is a powerful message.

You'll meet a teacher in this book who has a very interesting outlook on life... you'll know who I mean when you meet him. Let's just say, he was very much a good influence to help Jonah and his friends do what they do.

I gave this book four stars because it passes along a very good, and important, message about climate change and what needs to happen in the next few years if we don't want our children/grandchildren/great-grandchildren etc., to face a horrifying existence on a planet that is inhospitable. It also gives a great message about trusting in yourself and knowing you can make a difference even if you're "just a kid".
