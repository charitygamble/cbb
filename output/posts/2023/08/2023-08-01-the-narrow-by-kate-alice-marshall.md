Today I'm reviewing **The Narrow** by Kate Alice Marshall, a Young Adult Horror novel. This post is part of the [TBR & Beyond Tours](https://tbrandbeyondtours.com/2023/06/26/tour-schedule-the-narrow-by-kate-alice-marshall/) blog tour for **The Narrow**.

\[book-info\]

So we all know I'm a horror girlie, but I usually don't go in much for ghost story horror. Most of them are just so clich√© and boring to me that I don't want to read them. I'm also that way with horror films - in fact, there are only a couple of ghost-based horror movies I really like. So the fact that I gave **The Narrow** a 5 star rating, should tell you something.

## Characters

First, I love the characters. I love Delphine. I love Eden. I love the way Eden, Veronica, Zoya, and Ruth interact with each other. They're all strong characters. We get back story for those we need (Delphine, Eden, Maeve, and Grace) and no back story for the ones that don't matter as much (Veronica, Zoya, Ruth, and the adults).

## Atmosphere

This book had a great, creepy setting. A boarding school with a history of being haunted that exists near a raging river... and it rains a lot here, or does it? A dorm that is specially outfitted for a student with an extremely rare allergy... this one just has all the pieces for a great setting.

## Writing

Kate Alice Marshall's writing style is amazing. It is easy to read, fast paced, and doesn't overly describe things like my all-time favorite horror author tends to. Reading this takes hardly any effort - you don't have to think too hard, you just read and relax.

## Plot

This one takes a unique plot for a ghost-based horror novel. It takes possession to a different level by executing it in a different way. Add to this a love story and it becomes a great story that keeps readers interested and wanting to know more. At least it kept this reader wanting to know more.

## Intrigue

If there's one thing every thriller or horror novel needs, it is intrigue. You have to have a reason to want to know what happens next. And trust me, with **The Narrow**, you need to know what happens next. You can't just leave it alone. The intrigue is amazing in this book. It just works so well.

## Relationships

The relationships in this book are complicated but at the same time, not. For some relationships they seem to get more complicated as the book goes on, while others seem to get less complicated. I love the interactions between Eden and Delphine, Eden and Grace, and Eden and her friends.

## Ending

The ending to this book actually made me a bit sad. I understand why it has to end the way it does, and I'm grateful that it does end the way it does. But it still made me a bit sad because the person Eden fell in love with is one person she simply cannot have. It is amazing, beautiful, and sad all at once.

I highly recommend this book to those looking for a ghost story that isn't your typical ghost story. I also recommend this 5 star read to those looking to get started in YA Horror with something that isn't too terribly scary.

## Playlist

I don't usually make playlists for books and while this isn't the greatest playlist, I thought it was a decent collection of a few songs that made me think of **The Narrow**.
