Today I'm bringing you a review of **Credible Threats** by Daniel Meyer. This book is a Urban Fantasy novel in the Sam Adams series meant for anyone Young Adult to Adult. This review is part of the Escapist Book Company blog tour for **Credible Threats**.

Ok, so when the blog tour for **Credible Threats** was announced, it just seemed like it was going to be a great book and I wasn't wrong in the least.

Sam Adams is our teenaged wizard and along with Sam comes a cast of characters - some good, some not so good - that is truly amazing. Every character had a purpose and if they didn't, that character didn't have a name.

This book is action packed - you could almost say it is an action/fantasy combination. The action starts early and doesn't let up until the end of the book. This book was a page-turner and while I did put it down to do other things, it wasn't because I wanted to.

If you're looking for a good urban fantasy novel that combines magic, mayhem, action, and the mundane as well, set in a real-world setting, this is a great book to go with. At 4.5 stars, I highly recommend it!
