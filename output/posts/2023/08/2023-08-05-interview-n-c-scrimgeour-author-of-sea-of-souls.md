Today I’m pleased to bring you an interview with N. C. Scrimgeour, author of **Sea of Souls**. This interview is part of my stop on the blog tour organized by Escapist Book Co. Thank you for allowing me to participate, and thank you to N. C. Scrimgeour for answering my questions.

### Do you read reviews of your books? If so, how do you handle bad or good reviews?

I do, even though I know I shouldn’t! Good reviews always put a smile on my face, and even the more  
critical ones can be helpful in terms of self-reflection. There are always a couple that get under your skin,  
but I know as a reader I don’t enjoy every book either, so I try to just move on quickly and not let it bother  
me. At the end of the day, whether review is positive or negative, someone has taken the time and  
consideration to engage with my book, which is always appreciated.

### What is the best way you’ve found to market your books?

I focus nearly all of my marketing efforts in the first book of my series. If people enjoy Book 1, they’ll  
hopefully go on and read the rest of the series, so the most important thing for me is pushing the first  
book as much as possible. I do a bit of social media, but my main marketing strategy is using Amazon  
Ads, which helps keep sales ticking along. Once in a while, I’ll also do a 99c promotion and run a few paid  
newsletter promos at the same time, and those usually result in a decent boost!

### What was your favorite book as a child? Did it influence you to become a writer?

My favourite childhood book was **Watership Down** by Richard Adams. I don’t know how many times I’ve  
read it over the years—the cover is so worn and dog-eared, and the pages have seen much better days. I  
fell in love with the world and culture Adams created with these rabbits, and how well written they were as characters. I think Bigwig is one of the greatest fictional heroes of all time, and I still get chills when I read the line: “My Chief Rabbit has told me to stay and defend this run, and until he says otherwise, I shall stay here.”

I wouldn’t say **Watership Down** influenced me to become a writer—it’s hard for me to pinpoint any one  
book that made me want to start writing myself—but it’s a book that is incredibly close to my heart and  
made me fall in love with reading.

### What is your favorite thing to listen to while you write?

I find it difficult to concentrate on writing if there are lyrics (I just can’t help singing along!), so I usually  
listen to soundtrack music that fits the kind of theme/atmosphere of the book I’m working on. For Sea of  
Souls, I’ve mainly been listening to The Witcher 3, Greedfall, Black Sails, Dragon Age and Lord of the  
Rings.

### Do you ever have reader’s block or reading slumps? How do you get yourself out of them?

Reading slumps (and writing slumps!) aren’t uncommon for me. In both cases I usually try to give myself  
a bit of a break and not force it too much. Especially with writing—if I’m not in the right headspace for it, I  
know I’m not going to be happy with what I’ve produced, so it feels counterproductive. That being said, it’s important for me to try and realise the difference between feeling genuinely burned out and just feeling a bit lazy, so sometimes I just have to make myself power through!

### Do you read the genre of books you write? Do you read your own books after they’re finished?

I read almost exclusively fantasy and sci-fi, which are the two genres I write in. However, this is a habit I  
am trying to change as I know that by reading other genres and exposing myself to different  
pacing/structure/story beats, it will likely only improve my own writing. So that’s something I want to  
actively try to do this year.

When it comes to my own books, when they’re done, they’re done! I’ll have re-read them so many times  
already throughout the editing process that when they’re finally released, I’m happy to not have to look at them again—it’s up to the readers now. Maybe a few years down the line I’ll feel different and want to  
read them again, but right now it still feels too close.
