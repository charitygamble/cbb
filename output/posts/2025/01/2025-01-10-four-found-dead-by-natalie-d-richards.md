_Four Found Dead_ was one of those books that took me a while to read - mostly because it was a case of "right book, wrong time". I tried several times to read this book and just couldn't stay interested. Last night, I decided I'd give it one more try before giving up\[mfn\]The book was released almost 2 years ago now...\[/mfn\] and I'm glad I did. I started it at 10PM and finished at 3:45AM the next morning.

Once I was able to properly get into the book\[mfn\]Trust me, it was ME not the book\[/mfn\], I could not put the book down. I had to know what was going to happen next. While we didn't get to know all of the characters well, I have to say that my favorites were Naomi, Hudson, and Jo. However, I would like to have gotten Jo's name a bit earlier in the book than we did\[mfn\]Full disclosure, we actually could have gotten her name well before I noticed it\[/mfn\], but it is what it is. And I would like to say that I hated Clayton from his first entrance into the story. So there's that.

_Four Found Dead_ is quite fast paced - it would have to be, considering that the events take place over the course of about 9 hours. Once it pulls you in, you're hooked. You need to know how these people are getting out of this mess they're in.

I found the little "intermission" notes interesting. They left me wondering exactly who it was who was telling this story, or at least, who was giving their two-cents between some of the chapters. You will find out at the end, and trust me, it wasn't anyone I was expecting.

The ending is great and quite interesting. There are some things that are foreshadowed earlier, but then you kind of decide that can't be the case later... only to have it thrown in your face that it was true all along.

I gave this one 4.5 stars - it was a great book and now I'm planning to find other books by Ms. Richards as well.
