For the love of all that is holy, get a box of tissues before you read this book. I'm not even kidding. You will need them, especially towards the end.

Harper Lyons may not be your "typical" teenager, but I have to say, there were a few girls like her in my high school. Chases the boys, has sex, does drugs, drinks, you name it, she's probably done it or thought about it. But Harper doesn't really want to be that way, does she?

This book will hit you right in the feels, if you'll forgive the expression. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll be furious. Glen Sobey writes teenage angst and problems with the best of them. Do all such stories get happy endings? No, sadly they don't. But you'll love the ending of this one... mostly.

The way Glen Sobey writes his books, you'd think he has some sort of personal experience with the subject matter. He doesn't write like he's just imagining these things, he writes like he's lived it. Or perhaps like he knows someone who has lived these stories. This was the second novel of his I've read and I am determined that I'll read more of them!

If you don't find yourself relating to Harper, Gabriel, Cooper, Rachel, Greg, or Natalie, then I don't know what to tell you. I found ways to related to them all and found ways to connect with all of them. Zachary... let's just say that's one part of the story that didn't make me cry.

You honestly have to read this book. It's a superb rendering of how the love of a family member, even one you don't know very well, can lead to redemption. Definitely a 5 star read.

> I received a copy of this book free from Glen Sobey in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.
