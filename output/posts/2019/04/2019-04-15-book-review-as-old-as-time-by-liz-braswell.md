Who doesn’t love the tale of **Beauty & The Beast**? Well, except for a few people who seem to be hell-bent on dragging Disney’s version of the classic tale through the mud, claiming Belle has Stockholm Syndrom (which is actually addressed in this book). But have you ever wondered who the Enchantress was? Why she was so worried about this particular prince? Well, **As Old As Time** might just give you the “canon” answers you want.

**As Old As Time** explores the possibility of what would have happened had the Enchantress been Belle’s mother. I know, in the live action version of **Beauty & The Beast**, we are told that Belle’s mother died of Plague. But honestly, I like this idea much better.

Liz Braswell has done an amazing job of bringing the characters to life – including the ones that she created such as Alaric, Frederic, and Rosalind. She’s given a superb backstory to to the classic tale – even if this version doesn’t end quite like you might be expecting.

This is a 5 star read and if you’re a fan of **Beauty & The Beast**, you really need to read this.
