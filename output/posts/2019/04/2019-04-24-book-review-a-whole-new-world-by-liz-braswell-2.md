I’ve read some pretty unflattering reviews of this book. All I can say is, I don’t think they were reading the same book I was. I’m not even kidding. Many of the things people complained about didn’t seem to even be a part of the book.

Yes, the beginning of the book gives a recap of events at the beginning of **Aladdin**. It is not word-for-word as some have claimed and things were added to the story as well. When the story does branch away, which is well before most reviewers claimed it did, it immediately and completely changes. For the better, in my opinion.

Honestly, if **Aladdin** had gone like **A Whole New World**, I think it would be one of my favorite movies, even more than it already is. The action scenes are awesome. The feeling of pity for Street Rats, hatred for Jafar, and heartbreak at certain events make this a must read book. Five stars for this magnificent what-if version of **Aladdin**.
