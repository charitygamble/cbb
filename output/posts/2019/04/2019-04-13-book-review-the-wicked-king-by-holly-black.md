Another great novel that takes place in Faerie. You can really get a feel for how things work in the land of Faerie. You get to see war, love, betrayal, and you even get twists and turns you may not anticipate.

This book could not have been a more perfect sequel to _The Cruel Prince_. Questions were answered, more questions were raised.

You got to see what makes Jude and Cardan tick. I’ll be honest, I’ve been shipping them since _The Cruel Prince_. Locke, well, I’d like to smack him because I don’t think he’s right for Taryn and he’s such a brat.

Then again, by the end of _The Wicked King_, I’d rather have beaten Taryn, Madoc, and Cardan than look at them.

Cardan made me wonder what the hell he was thinking/doing, but I suppose the next book will give me the answers I need. This was another 5 star read from Holly Black and I can’t wait for _The Queen of Nothing_ to come out in January 2020. I’ve already pre-ordered my copy so I don’t have to wait for it at the library.
