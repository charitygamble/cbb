If you’re familiar with **Sleeping Beauty**, then you already know what **Once Upon a Dream** is going to be about. But trust me, this isn’t your Mom or Grandma’s **Sleeping Beauty**.

Liz Braswell has woven a tale that asks what if it required more than just true love’s kiss to break the curse on Aurora? What if Maleficent had to be defeated before the curse could be broken?

The world building in this story is top-notch. I didn’t even realize what was actually going on until a good way into the story. In fact, I didn’t figure out what was happening until just before Aurora figured it out.

Fans of **Sleeping Beauty** who crave a stronger princess will love this book. While I didn’t enjoy **Once Upon a Dream** as much as I did **As Old As Time**, this book still gets a solid 4 stars for awesome character use and building of the world.
