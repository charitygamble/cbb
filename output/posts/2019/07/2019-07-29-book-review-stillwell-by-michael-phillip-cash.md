I have to say, I enjoyed this book by Michael Phillip Cash much better than the other one I read. I'm a sucker for a good ghost story, and this one is good.

This ghost story has an interesting twist to it. It isn't often that you see something like this. Sure, you see happy endings to ghost stories, but this one is just too sweet, especially after the plot twist.

Once again, there wasn't a lot of character development, but honestly, this book really didn't need it. It didn't detract from the story, probably because the paranormal portion was so well thought out and so well written.

I would love to see more books like this from Michael Phillip Cash. I think ghost stories are where his greatest talent lies.
