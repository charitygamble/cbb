Ok, I'm all for reimagined fairy tales. After all, just look at the reviews I've done for three of the **Disney Twisted Tales** books. I love a good reimagined fairy tale. Please note I said a _good_ reimagined fairy tale.

**A Grimm Curse** is not a good reimagined fairy tale. As a prequel, I honestly feel this book raises far more questions than it actually answers. It is all over the place and makes absolutely no sense.

There are elements of **Rapunzel**, **Cinderella**, **The Frog Prince**, and even **Jack and the Beanstalk** in this book. Just in case you wondered, as a general rule, fairy tales don't crossover. Yes, I know... they do in **Into the Woods** and **Shrek**, among others. And it works in those places. But it didn't work here.

There was so little of **Jack in the Beanstalk** it seemed like that addition was pure afterthought - kind of like the author said "Hmm, I should add yet another fairy tale, but which one?? Oh! I know! I'll stick **Jack in the Beanstalk** at the end and hope no one notices." There wasn't much of **Rapunzel** either and you have no idea how Cynthia and Rapunzel became friends in the first place, they just were.

The story was just too disjointed and wonky for me to be able to enjoy it. I made it through because it's a relatively quick read - about 4 and half hours, but honestly, I won't read it again, nor would I consider reading the previous books in the series.
