When I saw the cover to this book, I was intrigued. It's the August book for the Barnes & Noble YA Book Club and I was anxious to see what the book was about.

I can't say the story was terrible, because it wasn't. But there was no feeling, no emotion between the characters. Reese, Byatt, and Hetty are supposed to be such great friends, best friends, but the story doesn't convey that. You're told that they're best friends, but you just don't get that feeling from the story.

Honestly, I think the only thing that truly kept me reading was wanting to see if an explanation for anything - the Tox, why they were being kept on the island - would be forthcoming. It does, but not in a very satisfactory way.

Then there is the ending of the book. The end of the book left me feeling like the story hadn't been finished. Like the author didn't know what to do after the closing scene, so she just decided to leave it there and hope for the best. I sincerely hope there is supposed to be a sequel, because otherwise the end is just a huge letdown.

I gave this book 3 stars because the author definitely has room for improvement. The writing style could use some work, especially when it comes to interpersonal relationships between characters and ending a book properly.
