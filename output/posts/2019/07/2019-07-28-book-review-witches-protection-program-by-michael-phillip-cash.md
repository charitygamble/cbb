It took me a long time to even start this book. I think I added it to my NetGalley queue in 2015, but I didn't start it until the other day. I'm not sure why it took me so long, but it did.

I have to say, Witches Protection Program isn't a horrible book. It's cute, it's kitschy, and it's a relatively quick read. That being said, it's also kind of bad.

There isn't a lot of character development. You don't really get to know the characters. And you're supposed to believe that two of the characters fall in love without either of them actually knowing anything other than the other person's name.

At least the plot twists made up for the lack of character development. There are a couple of pretty good revelations and twists that are pretty satisfying. That being said, I don't think I'd really recommend this book to anyone unless they just wanted a quick read.

> I received a copy of this book free from NetGalley in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own.
