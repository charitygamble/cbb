This book spent far too long on my Netgalley TBR pile. I'm not even joking. I added it to the TBR pile back in 2015 - almost 4 years ago. I honestly shouldn't have waited so long to read this book.

**Blueblood** is the second book in the Marty Singer series. The good thing is while the books might reference previous books, you don't absolutely need to read the previous books to understand what's going on. These books can be read in or out of order with no problem. You could even read one as a standalone and be pleasantly surprised when you pick up another one and realize it's a series.

I really like Marty Singer. He's a great character. An ex-cop who is willing to get his hands dirty for the right cause. In this particular case it was someone killing cops. He's thorough and you get a sense of who he is throughout the book. The book isn't all "business" there is a personal plot that runs through the book as well.

This book was hard to put down. It drew me in immediately and I finished in the same day I started reading it. I just wanted to know what was next. The action scenes weren't heart-pounding, but they weren't boring either. They were just right and I liked that, a lot.

I can't wait to read another of the Marty Singer books - I believe I have more of them in my NetGalley TBR pile and I will have to read them soon!
