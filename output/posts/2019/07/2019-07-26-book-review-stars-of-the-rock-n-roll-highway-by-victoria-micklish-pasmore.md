Before I give you my thoughts, let me preface it with the fact that I know it was meant for children. That being said, no. Just no.

First, I don't know any child who would actually care about old Rockabilly artists that were, in most cases, old enough to be their great-grandparents. Second, this book is dry. It's just a bunch of facts tossed down on paper - or in this case, in an eBook. There's no character, no life, just a more or less cold recitation of facts.

I could literally hear a boring teacher droning on in my head, reading this book to students who are doing anything they can to not fall asleep. That's how boring this book is. I didn't find any of the information particularly compelling to read and I certainly didn't care about it once I was done.

This is definitely not a book I'd get for any of the kids in my life unless I was trying to get rid of them.
