I admit, I was kind of scratching my head because on Goodreads, this book is listed as "erotica" and it really isn't. It's pretty much a romance book with some sex thrown in. I've read far more erotic and dirty books from authors like Linda Lael Miller, trust me. This was tame compared to her books.

Then I saw on NetGalley that the book's genre was actually New Adult and Romance, which made a lot more sense to me. The story is interesting and the book is a quick read at 132 pages on a Kindle. This was the 3rd book in a series, but you honestly don't need to read the first two books to be able to follow along. You'd think you'd need to, but you really don't.

I like a series where I can screw up and read them out of order and still be able to read the book without reading the previous books first. It makes it a lot easier.

I can't say I connected with or particularly liked any of the characters in this book. I also can't say that the writing was great. It was average and so were the characters. There wasn't anything special about them to be honest. However, I am more than willing to read further books by Priscilla West because the story lines and plots themselves are good and the books are quick reads.
