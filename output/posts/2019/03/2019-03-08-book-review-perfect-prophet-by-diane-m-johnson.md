What do you do when you don’t believe in God but you find yourself possessed of an ability that can only be a gift from God? What happens when your father is also a religious zealot who literally wrote prophecies about you – prophecies that have a Satanic cult after you? That’s what Alec Lowell is about to find out.

This book was very well written. It had a lot of action, a lot of suspense, and included a plot twist that I never saw coming. Diane M. Johnson has crafted a tale of Satanic cult zeal and atheism that sparks an edge of your seat novel.

The characters are well developed and they “show their hand” when they need to. For instance, you don’t find out much about Mark until you really need to know about him, then you’re surprised because he’s more than you thought he was. Lucas definitely isn’t who you thought he was the entire time.

Those who like books with a slant on religion will enjoy this book, as well as those who are looking for a good suspenseful book. I think those of us who are metalheads will also enjoy the book because of the musical beginnings of the book.

There is just one thing I wish I had – a story of Lucas’s life after the end of this book.
