If you want to see inflammatory reviews, just go look at the reviews for **The Testaments** on Goodreads. Several people have panned the book majorly, stating that the book wasn't necessary. I'm here to tell you that while those people might feel **The Handmaid's Tale** was fine as it was, it really wasn't.

What those illustrious readers and reviewers failed to understand was that **The Handmaid's Tale** left off with so many unanswered questions. What happened to Offred in the end? Did she survive? Was she ever reunited with her daughter? How long did Gilead exist after Offred's story ended? How did Gilead fall? We needed answers. This book provided them.

I was ecstatic to hear this book was coming out. I immediately set out to obtain a copy as soon as it was released, although it took me a few days to get to it. This book was amazing. It answered all the questions I had.

The book is written from the perspective of three people - Agnes Jemima, Daisy, and Aunt Lydia. Anyone who has read **The Handmaid's Tale** or even watched the series on Hulu knows who Aunt Lydia is. The other two, perhaps not so much. However, if you catch the clues, you'll figure out who Agnes Jemima is pretty quickly. Yes, there are clues. No, I won't tell you what they are.

This book had some very interesting twists in it. While I won't tell you the gory details, just know that Aunt Lydia has a very big role to play in this story. She gives more information about how the "Aunts" got their start in Gilead. She also does some things that might surprise you, considering her role in **The Handmaid's Tale** and how faithful she was to Gilead in that story.

Agnes Jemima was pretty easy to figure out once a couple of clues were given, but Daisy took a tiny bit longer to figure out. I had Daisy's true identity worked out long before it was stated in the book, but it didn't matter.

There is action and adventure in this book. There is heartache and there are horrors that we see in our world today. You will laugh at some of the antics, be horrified by some parts of the book, and wonder what is wrong with these people in most parts of the book. It's a must read if you've read **The Handmaid's Tale** and had any questions about Gilead, Offred, or Offred's daughter.

I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars because I honestly didn't want to stop reading it. I had to know what was going on. I had to see what would be revealed next. I know to get to the end. When I did, I was so happy because even after all this... they still treat Offred and other characters from **The Handmaid's Tale** and **The Testaments** as though they could be myths. It's awesome and I highly recommend this book.
