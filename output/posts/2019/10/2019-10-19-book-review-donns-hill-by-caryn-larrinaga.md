* * *

_Donn's Hill_ is a horror/mystery/thriller that involves the paranormal. As such, I knew I had to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed.

_Donn's Hill_ is Caryn Larrinaga's debut novel. As such, it does suffer a bit from "first book syndrome" but in all honesty, it doesn't really detract from the story. This one needs the long set-up to make it as impactful as it is. Not to mention this is the first book in a series, which makes it even more forgivable that the set-up takes as long as it does.

I really like Mac. She's funny, she's not overly happy with her gift at first, and honestly, she's just an all-around likable character. I also like Graham and Kit a lot. I'm on the fence about Penelope - I hated her at first, but things settled down and I don't quite hate her anymore. Of course, as a cat lover, I definitely love Striker.

I have a copy of Donn's Shadow, the second book in the series and I can't wait to get started on it because I'm sure it's going to be just as amazing as the first book. After all, there's still a ghost that might be harming people to get rid of.
