I have to say, I'm not a big fan of anthologies for some reason. Maybe it's the fact that a lot of anthologies I see are collections of stories that are in genres I'm not the biggest fan of - romance being a huge one, especially at Christmas time. So when I originally purchased _Slasher Girls & Monster Boys_, I didn't think I'd particularly like it. And to be fair, I think I read two stories, put it down, and never picked it up again. In fact, my copy is in the garage, in a box.

But then I decided to do the All Hallows' Read Challenge and I had to read an anthology and read a book that has been on my TBR for a while. So I picked this one. I didn't have the get-up-and-go to try and find my copy, so I checked it out of the library. I'm glad I picked it. I really am.

I'd never noticed before that each story is inspired by books and movies. There are stories inspired by Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, Stephen King's _Carrie_, and movies like _I Know What You Did Last Summer_, _The Birds_, and more.

While I enjoyed all of the stories, I think my favorite was _In the Forest Dark and Deep_ by Carrie Ryan. This one was inspired by the 1951 Disney animated film _Alice in Wonderland_ and _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll. I also quite enjoyed the rest of the stories, but for some reason this one sticks out. Perhaps because I love _Alice in Wonderland_ - to the point I own both the animated film and both Tim Burton adaptations, plus I have a digital copy of _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ because I lost my physical one and haven't replaced it yet.

All of these writers have an easy-to-read writing style... or perhaps I've read far too many Clive Barker, Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Anne Rice, and other horror novelists so I don't find it hard to read their writing style for horror. I will say that Jay Kristoff really likes that whole e-mail/chat style because that's featured in his story, _Sleepless_. But otherwise, the writing styles are easy to read.

If you use Bookly PRO I suggest reading this and listening to "Distant Thunders" or if you use Spotify, finding a playlist of thunderstorms. It lends the perfect spooky atmosphere for reading this anthology.

I gave the anthology four stars because I do think that some of the stories started out a bit too slowly and that some of the stories could have been a bit better. But I will say, this book was pretty amazing and I wouldn't be opposed to a "sequel" anthology from these authors.
