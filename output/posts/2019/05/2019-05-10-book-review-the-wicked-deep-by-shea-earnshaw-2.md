At first I wasn’t going to finish this book. I even turned it in to the library early. I’d gotten to Chapter 5 and it was just dragging along. But something kept nagging at me that I should give it another shot, so I downloaded the Kindle version as a library check out. I’m glad I did.

If I hadn’t given the book a second chance, I’d have missed out on an awesome plot twist that I honestly didn’t see coming. **The Wicked Deep** starts out slow but finishes in a way that makes it hard to put it down. I know. I read from Chapter 5 to the end in about 3 hours.

I recommend this to lovers of witch trials, paranormal, and romance books. I gave it 4 stars because of the slow start, but the writing and character building are awesome.
