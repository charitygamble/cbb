I’m not a big fan of Colleen Hoover. Most of her books are just not my style. I’m not into the contemporary, YA/New Adult romance thing. But this book, self-published because it was such a departure from her normal books, was right up my alley.

I’d seen a review on booktube for this book and new I had to check it out. So I got an eBook copy through the Books app on my iPad and went to town. It didn’t take me long to read it because I couldn’t put it down. This book is so amazing. You get little twists and turns right from the start, but the biggest twist comes at the very end of the book. That twist gave me chill.

The characters are awesome. You’ll come to love Jeremy and Lowen but hate Verity. You’ll come to feel sorry for Jeremy and what he’s had to put up with over the years. But then… you find some things out and discover maybe you hated the wrong person. This book is not for the faint of heart – it has some scenes that are sexual in nature, some scenes that may depict things that are upsetting.

I gave this 5 stars. It was just an awesome book and I absolutely loved it. I hope Colleen Hoover writes more of these books because I will definitely be reading them!
