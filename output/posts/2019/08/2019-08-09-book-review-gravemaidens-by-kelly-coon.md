I've been trying to read this book since I first downloaded it from NetGalley on May 1. The problem is, the book just doesn't really hold my interest.

The book is considered fantasy by many readers who've given it the genre of YA and Fantasy on Goodreads, but so far, there's no reason to call it fantasy. Unless you mean because of the world itself - but honestly, I've seen no indication of magic. Just primitive healing like you'd have found in medieval times.

I guess the biggest thing is that the book doesn't get to the point. I mean sure, you have to give the reader something to read, but you also don't need to take forever to do it. I made it almost 40% into the book and for the most part, the most exciting part was the selection of the Sacred Maidens.

I can't stand Kammani. She's whiny and annoying. She refuses to marry the boy who loves her because she wants to be a great healer. She wants to heal the Lugal for her own selfish purposes - to save her sister, _even though her sister doesn't want to be saved_. She's just a seriously annoying character that I can't get behind. I honestly don't care if she gets what she wants because I don't like her.

I didn't finish this book, which is why it has zero stars. Maybe I'll try again later, but honestly, as much as I hate the main character, I doubt it.
