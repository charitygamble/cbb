CW: Violence, Death

Tales from the Hinterland is the book of fairy tales that is featured in The Hazel Wood and The Night Country. Weirdly enough, I could never seem to get into either The Hazel Wood or The Night Country. Perhaps I just needed to read the fairy tales the fueled the story.

I love fairy tales - the darker the better. I'm a huge fan of the original Grimm's fairy tales. Yes, I do like the Disney versions as well, but in Grimm's fairy tales, you don't always have a happy ending. So it is with Tales from the Hinterland. These tales are dark, grim, and don't necessarily have happy endings - although I suppose it does depend upon your point of view.

The tales themselves are interesting - although one of them I recognized and I'm not sure if it's because I've read a similar tale or because it might have been featured in the part of The Hazel Wood I did get to read. In either case, the book was filled with deliciously creepy fairy tales. These fairy tales would honestly be a good read around Halloween.

One of the touches I particularly liked was the tie-in with The Hazel Wood. Not only is this the fairy tale book that is featured in series, but there is a title page that marks the tales as being written by Althea Prosperpine and collected by Melissa Albert. I love that touch - it makes it feel like this book really is the extremely rare book of fairy tales.

I gave this four stars because, like I said, I'm not sure that all of the tales were completely original. Again, the tale I recognized may have been told in The Hazel Wood, which is why I recognized it, but I feel like I actually read it in my book of Grimm's fairy tales.

If you have read The Hazel Wood, I recommend you read this to see what the big deal about this book is.
