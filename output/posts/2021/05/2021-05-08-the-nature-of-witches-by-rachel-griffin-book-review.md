#### Content Warning:

Death

When I first requested to be allowed to read **The Nature of Witches**, I wasn't sure what to expect. I've long been a fan of books that have magic in them, and if they tie that magic to witches, I'm especially intrigued. So, I was super happy to be given the chance to read this book before it was released. I was so not disappointed.

## The Concept

Rachel Griffin's concept of witches and magic in this book are unique and beautiful. The concept of witches being tied to the sun and that they each have their own season in which their magic is strongest makes a lot of sense. The concept of the Everwitch, whose magic is strong year-round - but with the current season's magic - is brilliant.

## The Dose of Reality

In **The Nature of Witches**, we get a taste of reality. The atmosphere is going crazy - because just like in the real world, the people are destroying the planet. We also get a dose of reality in the way that Clara hates herself and her magic when we first start out. We get to see her learn to deal with her trauma, love herself, and love her magic. We get to see Clara grow. Rachel Griffin handles these topics in a masterful way.

## My Favorite Characters

Clara is my favorite character. Her struggles mimic a lot of people in the real world's struggles - although hers are tied to magic and ours aren't. But the lessons can still be learned from Clara's journey. She's a complex character and I loved reading about here. She's smart, sassy, and has anxieties and fears just like the rest of us.

I also loved Paige. Although we only get to see bits and pieces of her, she's a fun character. She's as cold as her season, but that's to be expected... she is a winter after all. She's just an amazing character because you can tell that beneath the cold exterior she cares for Clara.

Sang is probably my second favorite character. His love, his patience, and his refusal to give up are the reason Clara is able to grow as much as she does during the course of the book. He's a character who is easy to fall in love with and he's the perfect companion for Clara.

## The Conclusion

The Nature of Witches is Rachel Griffin's debut novel and this novel is set to be a smash hit of a debut. I was blown away by this book - all of it's twists, all of it's turns, all of the emotions you feel as the book goes on. The turmoil Clara holds inside herself, the guilt, the trauma will break your heart and warm you as she learns to let go of it all.
