Let me start by saying I don’t normally go for romance books - as in, if the primary genre is romance, I tend to stay away. But... I admit, coming from a military family and having military friends, I am a sucker for military/ex-military books, so I gave this one a shot. I’m so glad I did. 

Allow me to say, I finished this book in about six hours or so, taking a couple of breaks. It’s a short, easy read, but it doesn’t lack for substance. There was a perfect balance between to romance and the suspense. Both elements were necessary to keep the story moving, and Leslie North did an amazing job with this. 

I loved the characters as well. I felt a connection to Nicole and Grant. I cared what happened to them. I loved that Michael wasn’t afraid to admit to himself that he still loves Nicole. And I hope we get more info and maybe even a story about Jed... because while he’s not in the story very long, I think he needs his own story. 

If you like books involving military/ex-military and romance, with some suspense thrown in for good measure, I highly recommend you give this book a try.
