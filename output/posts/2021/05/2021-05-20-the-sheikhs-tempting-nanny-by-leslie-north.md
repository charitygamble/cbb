Leslie North is a favorite of mine for when I need a quick read to settle my mind. The Sheikh's Tempting Nanny was no exception to this rule. Sarah and Imran are both likable characters that make you want to know what they're going to do next. Jamila and Hasan are hilarious, as are Ziad and Maryam. I found myself loving all of the characters in this book.

This book is paced quickly, has a little bit of steam but not too much, and has a fun storyline. It is perfect for when you need a quick read to take a break from heavier types of books - textbooks, horror, mystery, or fantasy. I loved this book and can't wait to read the other two in the series.
