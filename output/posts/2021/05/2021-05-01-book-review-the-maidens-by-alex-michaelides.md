Alex Michaelides has done it again. He had the best-selling debut in 2019 with The Silent Patient and he’s got another winner with The Maidens. 

I love a good mystery/thriller/suspense book. The less predictable the better. Trust me when I say that The Maidens is in no way predictable. The twists just keep coming in this book, you never know what to expect. Just when you think you might have something figured out, a twist comes up and leaves you with your mouth hanging open. I literally got chills from a couple of the twists.

My favorite character in this story, to be honest, was Fred. He was a bit obnoxious, but you could tell he was sincere. Fred is one of those characters that seem to be just some side character who will have no real role in the story. Then you find out you’re wrong. 

Mariana was a character that was likable enough. She can be annoying sometimes as well, but she’s an interesting enough character. Although I have to say - for a psychotherapist she’s a bit out of touch with herself. 

The rest of the characters, for me, functioned exactly as they should. They did what they were supposed to do, took whatever was thrown at them, and held up the way they needed to - or didn’t. 

One thing I will say - you’ll get a pleasant surprise during one of the chapters - but you won’t understand unless you’ve already read The Silent Patient. And no, you absolutely don’t need to read that first to read The Maidens. They’re two separate stories. 

If you liked The Silent Patient, you’ll love The Maidens. I recommend this for fans of psychological thrillers.
