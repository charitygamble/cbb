I am using a modified version of the CAWPILE rating system to do my review. If you're curious about the CAWPILE system, check out [this video by Book Roast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=561&v=vcXoB38tSUI)!

I'm going to be perfectly honest here - I've never watched Disney's **Hercules**. Everything I know about it is from playing the first **Kingdom Hearts** game. That's pretty much it. But, I love the Twisted Tales series, so I had to read **Go the Distance** regardless.

## The Characters

Since I hadn't seen the movie, I hadn't really met Megara or Phil. To be honest, I know who Hades, Hercules, Hera, Zeus, and the other Greek gods are because I do have a thing for Greek mythology. But Megara and Phil were two characters I hadn't met before.

### Philoctetes (Phil)

Again, my only interaction with this character before was playing the Colosseum in **Kingdom Hearts**. I hated the character in **Kingdom Hearts**, but I have to say, he grew on me in **Go the Distance**. He gave Meg sound advice, even if she didn't want to take it. At the beginning of the book, their distaste for each other is pretty clear. It was nice to see Meg grow on Phil and vice versa.

## Megara

Meg reminds me a lot of myself. I don't like to ask for help, I don't like to depend on others. I also lost family members at a young age, so I know what that is like. Meg's been hurt and that hurt is never more obvious than when she has to take on this quest for Hera. But she's a strong, funny character. She ties her own shoes and everything\[mfn\]You'll have to read the book to understand.\[/mfn\]

## The Atmosphere

Ok, I'm going to be perfectly honest, the atmosphere is pretty much what you'd expect. A good portion of the book takes place in the various settings in which Meg finds herself trying to complete her quest. So the atmosphere changes rapidly. I will say that the author did a fairly decent job of describing the various places that Meg and her gang found themselves in.

## The Writing Style

Believe it or not, this is actually the first book by Jen Calonita that I have read. I found her writing style easy to read. I was able to read this book fairly quickly, without having to struggle to understand what she meant. This is a good thing, especially in a YA novel. She doesn't use ridiculously flowery language when she writes, but she doesn't make it so basic you're rolling your eyes because a first grader could read it. I really like her writing style and I'm looking forward to reading more books by her.

## The Plot

I can't say I cared much for the premise and plot of the story at first. I was expecting a story that either took place during the course of the original movie or that at least changed something integral to the story. But this was more of an afterthought story - Hercules has received his godhood, but oh wait.... Meg's mortal. Oops. Better do something about that.

Again, this is probably because I haven't seen Hercules. I know, I know, I'll watch it eventually...

## The Intrigue

This book intrigued me mostly because it was part of the Twisted Tales series. But the book itself held a lot of intrigue as well. Would Meg be able to get into and out of the Underworld under Hades' nose? Would she have to sacrifice something to get out of the Underworld alive? These were questions I needed answers to as soon as I read what the second half of Meg's quest for Hera was going to be. So the book definitely kept me intrigued.

## The Logic

I have to admit, I didn't really see the logic in this particular installment of the Twisted Tales series. Maybe it's just the way my brain works, but you'd think Hercules would have seen an issue with him being a god and Meg being a mortal in the first place. Yes, I realize that there were instances in Greek mythology in which gods consorted with mortals, but not usually in a manner that made the god want to stay on Earth instead of on Olympus. I'm just saying. But of course, that little bit of flawed logic is necessary or we wouldn't have a story!

## The Enjoyment

I actually didn't really start to enjoy this book until Meg actually went to the Underworld to retrieve her ex's wife. At that point, I really started to get into the book and started enjoying it. That half of the book is what made me rate the book four stars instead of two or three. Had the book not picked up then, I probably wouldn't have rated it as high as I did.

## Overall Thoughts

The ending saved this book. This book was a solid 2-3 star read until I hit the ending - Meg trying to get out of the Underworld with her ex's wife was what made me start to actually love the book. Plus, the very ending of the book didn't hurt either. I thought the epilogue was just super cute.

I gave this book 4 stars. I think I'd recommend watching Hercules before reading this if you've never seen the movie. You might enjoy the book a bit better.
