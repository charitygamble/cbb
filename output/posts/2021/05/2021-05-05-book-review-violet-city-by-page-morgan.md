I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started this book. I’d read the description, but still didn’t know exactly what to expect.

Violet City is an alien invasion story and a romance all in one. You’d think the combination wouldn’t work, but it does, it really does.

I loved the characters - well, the ones you’re supposed to anyway. Penelope is sarcastic and I love it. She has such an attitude even though she’s scared to death.

Rowan is also quite funny. His manner of speech is hilarious to see, especially when he says certain things. He’s also not quite as keen on what’s happening as one might think.

The book is a quick read and keeps you interested and entertained the entire time. If you like alien invasion stories or quirky romances, this is the book for you.
