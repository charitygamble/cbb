I've been meaning to read **The Grace Year** for quite a while now. I'd tried for it on NetGalley but had been declined. No surprise there. But then, there just seemed to always be other books I wanted to buy or check out of the library. So a couple weeks ago, I bit the bullet and checked it out of the library. Definitely not mad that I did.

## The Story

I had a hard time deciding if I could actually call this book a dystopian novel or not. For one thing, most of the dystopian novels I read are set in a more modern era, usually after some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe has happened. The Grace Year seems to be set in a less modern time than most. But the ideas presented are definitely dystopian - and very misogynistic. But that's actually kind of the point.

Leave it to men to decide that women possess some sort of magic that lures men into their beds. Like really? While I realize it is a central concept to the book, I found myself rolling my eyes every time the people of Garner County or the girls in their grace year mentioned the girls' magic. I guess I'm a lot like Tierney, since she didn't believe in any of that bull either.

## The Characters

Tierney was a great main character. I loved seeing the story told from her point of view. I especially loved this part of the book:

> I wonder what I'd see if I came across Tierney James today. And now I'm talking about myself in the third person.
> 
> Tierney James, The Grace Year, Winter, pg 180

I can imagine the sarcasm with which she thought it to herself.

I also enjoyed Ryker quite a bit. The fact that he was willing to sacrifice everything for someone he was taught to fear says a lot about his character.

## The Ending

I have to admit, the ending kind of bugged me. I wasn't expecting it to end the way it did. However - I would love to see a sequel because I really think we need a continuation of the story.

## Final Thoughts

This book reminded me a lot of **The Handmaid's Tale**. The plots are totally different, but the idea that women are little more than property. That women have one specific purpose and must be useful. It's kind of why I want a sequel - we all know what happened to Gilead after **The Handmaid's Tale** ended thanks to **The Testaments**. I want to know if Garner County gets taken down in a similar fashion. I know I'd like to read that story.

I gave this 4 stars. If you liked **The Handmaid's Tale**, I think you'll enjoy this.
