If there is one thing I do like, it is a good mystery. This one was definitely one of the good ones. The first thing you learn in **A Good Girl's Guide to Murder** is that Sal Singh killed Andie Bell. At least that's what everyone in town believes. Except Sal's family and one other person. That person is our main character, Pippa.

## A Good Girl's Guide to Murder - The Main Characters

Pippa is sort of an interesting character. She's every faculty member's dream. Her homework is done on time and very neatly. She studies all the time. Even when she chose to prove Sal Singh was innocent, she worked on that all the time. While she is an interesting character, I don't think we got to see enough of her real personality. We got more of the workaholic than we did the actual person with Pippa. While she may be the main character in **A Good Girl's Guide to Murder**, she isn't the best main character I've ever seen.

Now we move on to Ravi Singh. Ravi is our second main character and Sal's younger brother. He and his family have been deeply hurt by town's belief that Sal killed Andie Bell. He would do pretty much anything to be able to have Sal's name cleared. His personality has been shaped by the events that took place in 2014, when his brother was declared as Andie Bell's killer. I wasn't attached to him either. He just seemed a bit flat to me somehow. Maybe it was because I read most of the book between midnight and three AM.

## The Review

I have to say that **A Good Girl's Guide to Murder** was a great book - as far as the plot went. The plot had a lot of action in it and it was a fairly fast read once I actually sat down to read it.

One thing I found interesting about the book is that it is clearly set in the United States. However, Holly Jackson lives in the UK (London to be precise) and so some things that are unique to that part of the world are found in the book. They're just little things, like everyone wanting tea instead of coffee. It doesn't detract from the book in any way and I actually enjoyed it.

If there is one thing that you will find in **A Good Girl's Guide to Murder**, it is mystery. First, the mystery of why Sal was pegged as Andie Bell's murderer. Then we have the mystery of who doesn't want Pippa investigating this case. Finally, we have the mystery of who really killed Andie Bell.

There are some heart-stopping moments in this book and it will definitely have you wondering what the outcome will be. I definitely never guessed it!
