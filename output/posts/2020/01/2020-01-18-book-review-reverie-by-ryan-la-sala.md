When the Barnes & Noble book club chose this book for the January book club, I was a little leary. I actually had this book from NetGalley and just couldn't get into it. I tried for months to get into the book and just couldn't do it. But, I hate to miss a book club, so I bought the book, hoping getting it in a physical copy would help. It did, but so did finally just sticking to it and getting through the first portion of the book.

I'm going to say this now - the only character I actually like is Ursula. The main character, Kane, is so annoying I want to reach through and just smack the daylights out of him. His thing of not being able to remember anything about his accident or who he was/what he was like before the accident, asking people what he was like or who he was before the accident, and _then not believing them_ drove me bonkers.

Adeline's attitude of seeming to be better than everyone is also annoying, Sophia's overprotective character makes me cringe, and Elliott spends most of his time trying to impress Ursula. Poesy is a whole other ball of wax... let me tell you. I still don't know if Poesy is biologically male and a drag queen, biologically female and dressed as a man for Kane and Poesy's first meeting, or if Poesy is simply supposed to be unknown in gender - Poesy is referred to as "he" once or twice, "they/them" at other times, and "she" at other times. It's a bit confusing and seriously easy to mis-gender Poesy because it's hard to keep track of gender on that character.

The writing is done very well. The editing not so much. There are several places were words are misspelled, the wrong words are used, and where words are missing, but that's a double edged issue - writing and editing. I mean, honestly, you'd think the editors would have noticed.

The story in and of itself is very creative. It gives a whole new perspective on "our own little worlds" and what could happen if those worlds managed to escape into reality. If you're looking for a YA fantasy with major LGBTQ+ rep, I suggest you read this book. If there's a sequel, I'm definitely going to read it.
