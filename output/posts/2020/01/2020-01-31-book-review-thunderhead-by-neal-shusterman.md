**SPOILER ALERT:** _There are a couple of spoilers given in this review. I apologize, but I found it very hard to talk about the book without giving anything away._

* * *

If you're looking for a second novel in a trilogy or series to frustrate the crap out of you, this one will do nicely. I'm not even kidding.

In this second book, we see that Citra is getting along fairly well as a Scythe and the Rowan is playing a bad-guy-who-is-actually-a-good-guy role. I kind of figured that would end up happening, but that's isn't the frustrating thing.

We also see the return of Scythe Rand and Scythe Goddard. No, I won't tell you more than that. You have to read the book to understand. But trust me, when it happens you'll be frustrated, annoyed, and a bit awestruck as it is a big on the ingenious side.

Thunderhead has a plot that takes no time to get going and honestly, this book was the fastest read of the three so far. I read this book in just over 24 hours - it took me over a month to read **Scythe** and finish it because I just wasn't invested in the story (and because I was in a reading slump). Now? I'm invested. Holy cow am I invested.

It's hard to review **Thunderhead** without giving everything away, because pretty much everything I could talk about would be a spoiler and I've already given a couple of those out. So all I'm going to say is, it will frustrate you. You will get pissed off about the ending. And you'll definitely want to read **The Toll** after it's over to find out what happens next.

This one is fast-paced and edge-of-your-seat good, which is why I gave it 5 stars. Let's hope **The Toll** is too.
