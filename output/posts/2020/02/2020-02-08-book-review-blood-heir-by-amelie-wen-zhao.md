In case you didn't know, this book is basically a retelling of Anastasia with magic and fantasy built in. Let me tell you, it works.

I love the concept of the Affinites and their affinities. I love that it isn't just your basic elements, but that Affinites could have any number of things for their affinities. We see marble affinities, flesh affinities, blood affinities, grain affinities, as well as the basic elements. So the concept of having an affinity for a particular element has been taken much further than normal, which is awesome.

Ana is a great character. She's tough, but she loves with all her heart. She loves her empire and she loves her people. And yes, she is naive when it comes to some things because she did spend the majority of her life living behind the Salskoff Palace walls. So there are things that she doesn't know regarding the empire she loves.

I also liked Ramson's character. He's no stranger to tragedy and he knows exactly what goes on with the Affinites and how they are treated. He gives Ana a rude awakening to how things really are in her empire, which helps to move the story along very well.

As for the story, again, it's a retelling of Anastasia and it's very well done. I found no issues with the writing style as it was easy to read and the plot made me want to keep reading the book.

Now, to address the controversy that surrounded this book. You can read an explanation of the controversy here. There are some things that I can see - such as people feeling that the author took things from other books. There's a sentence that is the same as in a Tolkien novel, as well some "copying" from The Hunger Games. I don't think it's actually enough for people to accuse her of plagiarism, because let's face it, some of these things are found in multiple books, but it gave people something to gripe about.

The other issue was that the book was seen as anti-black. Part of this is due to May, a character that started off as a slave, and ended up as Ana's companion. May is a little girl who came to the Cyrilian Empire with her mother - both were Affinites - and her mother was contracted to a different employer than May was. Ana was trying to help May find her mother.

At one point in the book, May does something that causes her death while attempting to save Ana. This is construed as a black girl being killed to allow a white girl to live. Ok, first, descriptions of May have her as "tan" skinned and "ocean blue" or "aquamarine" eyes. I'm not sure about you, but I don't see too many black people who are just "tan" and have "ocean blue" eyes. I also don't get where they get that Ana is "white" because she is described multiple times as having olive colored skin - which is a trait that several Middle Eastern and Asian cultures would be described as having.

I also heard some things on social media about how insensitive she was when she portrayed slavery. Well, slavery isn't something that you can portray sensitively, and frankly, she portrayed it in a way that was very common at one point - indentured servitude. An employer would "buy" someone and that person would have to work to pay off their employment contract and gain their freedom. It wasn't right in real life, it isn't right in a book. And just like in real life, people didn't like that it was going on and wanted to change it.

The controversy surrounding the book caused the author to delay the release of the book. She considered editing the book to fix what people said was wrong and ultimately decided to release the book as originally written. I'm sure people "cancelled" her because that's what social media does - they cancel everything and everyone they think is wrong or they don't like. But I'm glad she didn't change her story. Because if she had, it wouldn't be the amazing book it is.
