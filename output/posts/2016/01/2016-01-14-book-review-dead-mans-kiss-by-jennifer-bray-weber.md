I have to say, I enjoyed this book. I'm not a big "romance" fan anymore. Most of the books just seem to be far too boring or have little-to-no story beyond the sexual tension between the hero and heroine of the novel. I'll be honest, there is plenty of sexual tension between Catalina and Valeryn, but there was also a story line being carried out beyond the sexual tension.

Pirates have long been a favorite thing of mine to read about when reading romance novels but it seems that not too many authors delve into the realm of pirates anymore. Or maybe I'm just not looking in the right places. In any case, it is nice to know that it isn't all military-based books or books that should technically be considered erotica instead of romance. This book has some sexual scenes but not nearly as much as one would expect from a romance novel being written and published today.

Being that this book is self-published, I am highly impressed with the quality of the writing, because let's face it, a lot of self-published novels aren't very good. Many of them are poorly written or poorly edited and most times the poor writing style or shoddy editing detracts from an otherwise good story idea. Thankfully neither is the case here. I look forward to reading other novels from the Romancing the Pirate series.
