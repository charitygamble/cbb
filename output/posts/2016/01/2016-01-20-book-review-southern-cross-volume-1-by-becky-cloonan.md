Ok, here goes. I am not usually a comics/graphic novel person. Probably because I'm not big on pictures in my books. I literally dislike graphics, pictures, graphs, charts, etc., in my books when I'm reading. I'd rather have the information with nothing breaking it up other than maybe different colored/sized headlines.

I have to say, Southern Cross was very interesting. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading it and I certainly didn't expect the ending! It kept me interested from beginning to end. While in some spots it seemed the artwork could use some work, that could also have been due to my reading it on a computer screen instead of on paper as comics/graphic novels were meant to be.

The story line is fascinating and honestly, I'm hoping that the author/artist is intending to continue past the ending of this volume because I'd love to know what happens next!
