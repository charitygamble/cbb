It took me a bit to get into this one, but once I did, I was hooked. I admit, I have a BDSM fetish when I read–if the fan fiction I tend to read is any indication–so any book that includes that is generally a winner with me. I have to say though, this is the first time I've actually liked any of the erotica novels I've tried reading.

I usually find romance/erotica novels to be poorly written and laughable with what the characters are trying to do in the bedroom, but I definitely didn't find that issue in this novel. Plus, most romance/erotica novels have little in the way of actual story other than the copious amounts of sex that are featured. This book actually has a story that goes with it and it's an intriguing one at that.

Yes, this is the second in a series, but you don't need to read the first book, The Gilded Cuff, to understand what is going on or enjoy this book. The story line is a great one and it stands on its own very well. I have to say that I do want to read The Gilded Cuff and the story that comes after this one, The Gilded Chain, because if I enjoyed The Gilded Cage this much, I'm sure to enjoy those as well.
