Starve was, in a word, amazing. I was absolutely captivated, only breaking when I need to blink my eyes away from my screen for a few seconds. I didn't want it to end and was sad when it did.

What intrigued me was the fact that the graphic novel was based around a cooking show. Around a celebrity chef who'd disappeared for years on the other side of the world and suddenly is brought back to compete on the show he created. It's so hard to describe how I feel about this graphic novel. I'm sincerely hoping I can have a chance to read and review Volume 2 because the way this ended, there has to be a Volume 2 or I might just cry!
