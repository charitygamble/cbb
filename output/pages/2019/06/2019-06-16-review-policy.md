### Review Policy

## Preferred Genres

My preferred genres for reading are as follows, leaning heavily on Young Adult/New Adult books:  

- Horror
- Sci-Fi/Fantasy
- Paranormal (ghosts, witches, zombies, etc.)
- Dystopian/Post-Apocalyptic
- Mystery/Thriller

## Genres I Do Not Read

I am not a fan of the following genres:  

- Non-fiction
- Biographies
- Autobiographies

Exceptions to the biography/autobiography rule are music related, such as band or musician biographies/autobiographies. I love those.  

## Book Formats

I accept both physical copies of books and eBooks. I currently use the following eBook applications on my iPad - Kindle, Nook, iBooks, and Adobe Digital Editions.  

## Review Information

No money is ever accepted for writing a book review. Book reviews will always be my own opinions and will not always be positive. If you are looking for positive reviews only, please do not approach me about reviewing your book. I will **not** contact you prior to posting a negative review of the book. Regardless of the source of the books, this is still my blog and my true opinion will be expressed.  
  
**Regarding deadlines**: If you have a specific date by which you want your book to be reviewed, you **must** tell me when you originally contact me. I generally read books based on if they're due back to the library soon or what book looks good to me at the moment, so I really need to know if I need to read a book by a certain date. Thank you!
