I have a few rules for the comments section, they're easy, so don't worry. These rules will be added to when I find that new rules are necessary, so don't be alarmed if you see the rules changing.

**Rule #1 - Don't be a jerk.**  
I don't tolerate flaming or trolling around here. You don't have to agree with the reviews I post, you don't have to agree with other people who post their ideas, but you also don't need to be a complete asshat about it either.

**Rule #2 - Don't spam.**  
Seriously, this is one of the most obnoxious things you can possibly do. It will get you banned from the blog, so I suggest you not do it.

**Rule #3 - Self-promotion is OK, but don't get carried away.**  
I don't mind if you plug your own book blog with comments like "I reviewed this book too! Check it out at my blog!" But don't just drop a "You should check out my blog, it's super cool and you'll love it." That's irrelevant. Also, if I click your link and find your blog has nothing to do with books, I'll remove your comment and ban you from the blog.

**Rule #4 - No impersonating authors, publishers, etc.**  
Look, we all hope an author might comment on our review of their book, but the last thing anyone wants is some jerk commenting and claiming to be an author, publisher, etc.. Just don't do it.
