<p>A terrifying thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of Five Total Strangers and Seven Dirty Secrets!</p>

<p>The last show has ended, but the nightmare is just beginning.</p>

<p>Tonight, Riverview Theaters is closing forever, the last remaining business in a defunct shopping mall. The moviegoers have left, and Jo and her six coworkers have the final shift, a shift that quickly takes a dark turn.</p>

<p>First a stranger arrives with a chilling accusation. Then the power goes out and their manager disappears, along with the keys to the lobby doors and the theater safe, where the crew's phones are locked each shift. The crew's tension turns to terror when Jo discovers the dead body of one of her co-workers.</p>

<p>Now their only chance to escape the murderer in their midst is through the dark, shuttered mall. With its boarded-up exits and disabled fire alarms, the complex is filled with hiding places for both pursuer and pursued. In order to survive this night, Jo and her friends must trust one another, navigate the sprawling ruins of the mall, and outwit a killer before he kills them all.</p>

<p><i>Four Found Dead</i> was one of those books that took me a while to read - mostly because it was a case of "right book, wrong time". I tried several times to read this book and just couldn't stay interested. Last night, I decided I'd give it one more try before giving up and I'm glad I did. I started it at 10PM and finished at 3:45AM the next morning.</p>

<p>Once I was able to properly get into the book, I could not put the book down. I had to know what was going to happen next. While we didn't get to know all of the characters well, I have to say that my favorites were Naomi, Hudson, and Jo. However, I would like to have gotten Jo's name a bit earlier in the book than we did, but it is what it is. And I would like to say that I hated Clayton from his first entrance into the story. So there's that.</p>

<p><i>Four Found Dead</i> is quite fast paced - it would have to be, considering that the events take place over the course of about 9 hours. Once it pulls you in, you're hooked. You need to know how these people are getting out of this mess they're in.</p>

<p>I found the little "intermission" notes interesting. They left me wondering exactly who it was who was telling this story, or at least, who was giving their two-cents between some of the chapters. You will find out at the end, and trust me, it wasn't anyone I was expecting.</p>

<p>The ending is great and quite interesting. There are some things that are foreshadowed earlier, but then you kind of decide that can't be the case later... only to have it thrown in your face that it was true all along.</p>

<p>I gave this one 4.5 stars - it was a great book and now I'm planning to find other books by Ms. Richards as well.</p>
