<p>I just want to thank HarperCollins for sending me this book - I got it late September/early October last year and just now got around to reading it. As per usual when it takes me awhile to get around to reading a book, I wish I'd read it sooner!</p>

<p>I could not put this book down. I think I started it around 8PM and finished it just after midnight. Ms. Lynch wrote this book with so many secrets, twists, and turns that I couldn't stop reading because I had to know what was coming next.</p>

<p>We have six main characters:
<ul>
<li>- Rosalee - the bride-to-be</li>
<li>- Tinsley - Rosalee's cousin</li>
<li>- Mara - Rosalee's best friend</li>
<li>- Bri - the soon-to-be sister-in-law</li>
<li>- Elizabeth - the soon-to-be mother-in-law</li>
<li>- Georgia - Rosalee's fiancé's best friend</li>
</p>
<p>All of them come with their own sets of secrets, reasons why they might be a murder victim or why they might have committed the murder. Oh, by the way, you don't find out who was actually murdered until nearly the end of the book... even though you start off with the crime scene. It's amazing!</p>

<p>Usually I have to try to guess who murdered the victim, but I know who the victim is. With <em>The Bachelorette Party</em>, not only did I have to try to guess who the murderer was, but who the victim was as well. I'm telling you, it makes the mystery even more fun when you don't even know who died!</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, as much as I loved the book, I can't say the same about any of the six main characters. None of the particularly spoke to me and frankly, all of them have something that makes them unlikeable. I will say my least favorite character was Mara - she rubbed me the wrong way from the moment she appeared. But I didn't really like any of the others either.</p>

<p>The setting though - New Orleans... a creepy old gothic mansion that is purported to be haunted? Yes please! I'll absolutely take that setting any day of the week.</p>

<p>Ms. Lynch's writing style is beautiful and easy to read. You won't find yourself bored or reading a ton of cliché phrases because the writing is exciting and doesn't rely on tired phrases like everyone's favorite "I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding".</p>

<p>I highly recommend you check out <em>The Bachelorette Party</em> by Carissa Ann Lynch if you are a mystery/suspense lover. You'll be glad you did!</p>
