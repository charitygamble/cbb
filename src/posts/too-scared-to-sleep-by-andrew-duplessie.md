Come on, it's horror. You know I had to give it a shot. It's meant for teens/young adults, so it isn't super scary - or maybe I'm just so jaded when it comes to horror that nothing really scares me anymore.

I was pleasantly surprised at the stories. A lot of the time when I find horror anthologies by authors I haven't heard of, they're either not good at all or there are only one or two good stories with the rest being mediocre at best. Not true with this anthology. All of the stories were really good. Again, not as scary as I'd have liked, but this wasn't written with adults in mind, so there is that. Younger teens and tweens would probably find this book scarier than I did.

My favorite stories in the book are "The Secret Sister", "Stage Fright", and "The Bone Fairy". That's not to say the others weren't great, because they were. But those three top my list for stories in the book.

If you're someone who likes horror but doesn't like it to be too scary, I think this book is a good one to try out. I also think it's a good introduction to horror for younger audiences who might not yet be used to the world of horror.
