<p>It's an honor to bring light to the dark. The nineteenth-century whaling village of Warbler is famous for its lucky ship figureheads--and infamous for people disappearing into the nightly fog. In this murky locale, the lamplighter is synonymous with safety and protection, and it's a position Temperance assumes when her father is found hanging from one of the lampposts. Though Tempe proves competent, the town is still hesitant to let a woman handle this responsibility. When a girl disappears after two lamps go out, Tempe's ability to provide for her mother and younger sister hangs in the balance. She scrambles for answers, hindered at every turn by the village authorities' call for her removal. As more villagers vanish under her watch, Tempe discovers unsettling truths about the famous Warbler figureheads and her own beloved father. But her warnings of a monster are ignored, even by her own family. Now she must follow the light out of her own fog of despair, as she faces the choice to look the other way or risk speaking out and possibly dooming herself and her sister to be among the lost.</p>

<p>I have to say - this book would have been a great read in October and indeed, I may have to re-read it for October. This book is perfectly creepy, what with a fog that covers the town of Warbler every evening. Even creepier when you discover where that fog originates from.</p>

<p>I loved Temperance. She is fiesty and protective of those she loves. Her insistence on making her own way and working as the lamplighter, as well as her troubles as the lamplighter because she is a woman are a grim reminder that even today, women are not always seen as equals to men.</p>

<p>Prudence is another character I was fond of. She is fiesty, loyal, and protective as well, but in her own way. The sisters have very different ways of living their lives, which is well played out in the book.</p>

<p>Gideon... well, at times I liked him, but most of the time I despised him. Which is probably what was intended.</p>

<p>Josiah was a sweet character and I wish we'd seen a bit more of him in the book. But alas...</p>

<p>The plot for this book is pretty amazing. A small whaling town overtaken by fog every night. If the lamplighter doesn't do his/her job, then people go missing because of the fog. This one is full of twists, turns, and will make you second guess yourself constantly.</p>

<p>While I loved the ending, it makes me hope for a sequel because... well, once you read the book, you'll understand why it is I hope for a sequel. Ms. Bell, if you are reading this, I beg you, please, write a sequel. Your ending begs for one!</p>

<p>I gave this 4.5 stars because it is an amazing book. I can't wait to see what other YA Horror gems she writes.</p>
