When I chose to read _The Debutantes_ by Olivia Worley, I did so based purely on the cover. I love the cover to this book so much, even though I can't exactly tell you why. It just jumped out at me as something I should read. And my intuition was spot-on.

_The Debutantes_ is what _Pretty Little Liars_ would have been if it was set in New Orleans. Dead and missing friends, danger, secrets being exposed, mysterious masked people.... Yep, _Pretty LIttle Liars_ in New Orleans backed by Krewe culture and, to an extent, Debutante culture. Honestly, that's one of the reasons I loved it so much. I loved _Pretty Little Liars_.

Reading this book kept me on my toes. I didn't want to put it down, and honestly, I stayed up until 6AM to finish it! It was so easy to read, so easy to follow that I just didn't want to stop reading. That's one of the ways in which it differs from _Pretty Little Liars_ - you won't need a spreadsheet to keep track of what's going on. Also, _The Debutantes_ won't need sixteen books to wrap everything up - it was all wrapped up neatly at the end. Or was it?

The ending was amazing and wrapped the book up well. Does it wrap the full story up? It actually could. But could there be more books? I think there could, if Ms. Worley wants there to be more books. I'm sure there's a way to add a sequel or two to this plot.

As for the characters, I really enjoyed Vivian and April. I wasn't as much of a fan of Piper's, mostly because she drove me crazy with the way she behaves. However, I didn't like Lily at all. Granted, we don't see a lot of her, but she just doesn't seem to be a genuine person in this story. She isn't sincere in anything she says or does and it just bugs me.

I gave this book five stars because it was an excellent book that made me want to keep reading - even after it was over. I hope to read more from Ms. Worley in the future!
