<p>Would You Swipe to Die?</p>
<p>When the new craze takes over Bleak Haven High, Ava Wilson refuses to join in. As the niece of an infamous murderer, it’s the last thing she needs.</p>
<p>The mysterious website allows people to view their own ‘death’ – an AI generated version of their final slasher-movie-moments. But, when some of her classmates’ deepfakes are replicated in real life, Ava can either catch the killer…or be the next victim.</p>

<p>Again, we all know I love horror and I love YA novels, so a combination of the two is a dream come true. Trust me when I say, <em>Dead Fake</em> by Vincent Ralph is no exception.</p>
