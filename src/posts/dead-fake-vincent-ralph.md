Would You Swipe to Die?

When the new craze takes over Bleak Haven High, Ava Wilson refuses to join in. As the niece of an infamous murderer, it’s the last thing she needs.

The mysterious website allows people to view their own ‘death’ – an AI generated version of their final slasher-movie-moments. But, when some of her classmates’ deepfakes are replicated in real life, Ava can either catch the killer…or be the next victim.

Again, we all know I love horror and I love YA novels, so a combination of the two is a dream come true. Trust me when I say, <em>Dead Fake</em> by Vincent Ralph is no exception.

_Deep Fake_ is a story that you won't want to put down. I know I didn't. It was the first book I've read in months that wasn't for school, so that should tell you something. I gave this book 5 stars - and I have the second book already queued up on my Kindle!
